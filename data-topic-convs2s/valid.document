but a letter seen by the daily telegraph suggests theresa may believes it would pose a security threat . the letter , written by mrs may 's private secretary , says she believes the plan is " unacceptable " . on tuesday , mr hunt set out a strategy to give uk tourism a boost following london 's games and said ministers were looking at simplifying visa applications for non-eu nationals . the strategy focused on attracting visitors from china , where the government thinks there is potential to triple the number of tourists - generating more than Â£ 500m in extra spending and creating more than 14,000 jobs . currently , visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of europe - but a separate one is required to travel to the uk . countries such as france and germany are far more successful at attracting chinese visitors , and the uk could do better if getting a visa was easier , mr hunt has suggested . but a letter from mrs may 's private secretary to the prime minister 's private secretary said the current rules were a " key tool in protecting the public against significant harm " . there are already 400 chinese criminals awaiting deportation and 1,000 asylum applications from chinese citizens last year , it said . " the proposal ... is not acceptable to the home secretary for national security reasons , " the letter said . " we also face significant challenges with foreign national offenders and organised crime , including drugs , money laundering , fraud , criminal finances , intellectual property , immigration and cyber crime . " but mark tanzer , chief executive of the association of british travel agents ( abta ) , said : " in the absence of concrete data about visa abuse , it is impossible to determine whether the right balance is being struck between the uk 's commercial interests and its security needs . " he argued that " proper visa monitoring and reporting processes " were needed , and any abuses of the system could be addressed as they arose . " we must not forget that visas are only one of the factors that deter chinese tourists from visiting us - lack of air routes and high aviation taxes also depress demand , " he added . mr tanzer
