sailing olympian shirley robertson carried the flame in newport . the day began at bournemouth pier and the 59 - mile route will include a stop at southampton football club 's ground . the flame travelled through 12 communities on saturday : bournemouth , boscombe , christchurch , lyndhurst , brockenhurst , lymington , totland , yarmouth , carisbrooke , newport , east cowes and southampton . at midday the convoy boarded a ferry from lymington to the isle of wight . and fittingly , it was there that sailor dame ellen joined the relay in east cowes which is famous for its week - long regatta . cowes has hosted the sailing event since 1826 and it is now the largest of its kind in the world . dame ellen is best - known as a solo long - distance yachtswoman , who once held the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe . she said after carrying the torch : " the other torchbearers are inspiring people who were wonderful to meet but the strongest impression i have from today are the faces - smiles , smiles and more smiles from young and old alike . " the sense of pride , happiness and community was my lasting feeling - all brought alive , in an instant , by the olympic torch . " another of britain 's finest sailors , ms robertson , was among the day 's 92 torchbearers . she was the first british woman to win two olympic gold medals at consecutive games - in sydney 2000 and then four years later in athens . search maps , check street routes and join in 70 days of live coverage in video , stories and pictures find out where the olympic torch is going other highlights of the relay 's journey on the isle of wight included a visit to osborne house - which was built as a summer residence and retreat for queen victoria , who died there in 1901 , and prince albert - and a trip for two torchbearers on the needles chair - lift at alum bay beach . blue peter 's big olympic tour was due to have been held at osborne house but was moved to bournemouth when the site became waterlogged . later in southampton , the flame was exchanged by the side of the
efforts by the members of the international community to influence and bring an end to the conflict are also mentioned . demonstrators demanded the release of political prisoners , but some were shot dead by security forces , triggering unrest that gradually spread throughout the country . the syrian uprising , then a month old , experienced its bloodiest day so far on 22 april when 72 protesters were killed by security forces firing on crowds . many of the dead were in the southern village of ezra , near deraa and in a suburb of damascus . in june 2011 , the syrian government announced that 120 security personnel had been killed in the north - western town of jisr al - shughour . the figure may have been inflated but it was a major attack and , as the bbc 's correspondent jim muir said at the time , it showed that the government was facing an armed uprising rather than mass peaceful protests . opposition groups formed the syrian national council and pledge to overthrow president bashar al - assad . the arab league voted to suspend syria , accusing it of failing to implement an arab peace plan , and imposed sanctions . villages in the area of jabal al - zawiya in idlib province were the site of a massacre of army defectors . opposition activists said around 70 soldiers were mown down by machine - guns on 19 december after hundreds fled their positions between the villages of kafrouaid and kansafra . this was later backed up by eyewitnesses and a report by human rights watch . the london - based syrian observatory for human rights said a further 111 people - also mostly army defectors - were hunted down by the army and killed the next day in an " organised massacre " . syrian forces began shelling the restive city of homs on 3 february , in what was to become a month - long bombardment . early reports talked of as many as 200 deaths , but one of the main activist groups later revised its confirmed number down to 55 . the bbc 's paul wood , who was in homs travelling with fighters from the free syrian army , described a city under siege . the bodies of 45 people , mostly women and children , were found in
security company fireeye and spam - tracking service spamhaus worked with local internet service providers ( isps ) to shut down the illegal network . a botnet is a network of computers that has been hijacked by cybercriminals , usually by using malware . " grum 's takedown resulted from the efforts of many individuals , " wrote atif mushtaq , a security researcher with fireeye . " this collaboration is sending a strong message to all the spammers : stop sending us spam . we do n't need your cheap viagra or fake rolex . " mr mushtaq wrote that on monday he learned that a dutch server involved in grum had been shut down . he said it " at least made a dent " in the botnet . on tuesday , the command and control servers ( cncs ) in panama had been shut down . " this good news was soon followed by some bad news , " he explained . " after seeing that the panamanian server had been shut down , the bot herders moved quickly and started pointing the rest of the cncs to new secondary servers in ukraine . " so at one point , i was thinking that all we needed was to take down one russian server , but right in front of my eyes , the bot herders started pointing their botnet to new destinations . " he noted that in the past ukraine has been something of a " safe haven " for bot herders . " shutting down any servers there has never been easy . " disabling grum is just one of many high - profile efforts to neutralise botnets worldwide . russian georgiy avanesov was in may sentenced to four years in jail for being behind the bredolab botnet which was believed to have been generating more than £ 80,000 a month in revenue . microsoft has been working to disrupt zeus , another huge network responsible for , researchers said , millions of pounds in theft . fireeye collaborated with other experts in the worldwide security industry to apply pressure to local isps to suspend the illegal operation . mr mushtaq said more than 20,000 computers were still part of the botnet , but that without the active cncs they would soon be rendered ineffective . grum 's closure was an encouraging development in
they said tuesday 's record 7.6 % yield on 10 - year spanish bonds - the government 's implied borrowing costs - did not reflect economic fundamentals . mr guindos will meet french finance minister laurent fabius on wednesday . spain 's financial situation continues to worry investors , with borrowing costs rising and the catalonia region saying it will need government funds . on tuesday , spain claimed italy and france back a plan for the immediate implementation of measures agreed last month . these include aid directed at spain 's banks without adding to national debt . spain said there had been a " worrying delay " in executing the agreements thrashed out at the eurozone leaders summit on 29 june . the main provision would be to allow the future european bailout fund , the esm , to pour money directly into ailing banks such as those in in spain , circumventing national governments . the creation of the fund has been hampered by constitutional challenges in germany which mean berlin will not be able to ratify the agreement before 12 september . " speed is an essential condition for the success of any european action , " the statement released by the spanish foreign ministry said . but , france 's european affairs minister bernard cazeneuve denied any accord with italy and spain on immediate implementation . " it makes no sense to say that . we are following the decisions taken at the european summit and are working on them , " said mr cazeneuve . the italian government also categorically denied that it was part of any joint initiative with spain . the record high yield on the spanish government 's benchmark 10 - year bond reflects tension in the markets over the strain on its finances . rating agency moody 's warned spain was more likely to need a full bailout , putting pressure on the euro 's strongest economies , such as germany . by andrew walkerbbc world service economics correspondent higher borrowing costs can make the difference between a debt situation that is a problem and one that is ultimately unsustainable . but the impact on the interest bill is slow , and that is why a spike in bond yields does n't immediately wreck the spanish government 's finances . it 's like turning an oil tanker . when governments
