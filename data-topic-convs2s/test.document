a survey in 2007 showed that bleeding canker had spread rapidly , with almost half of the two million horse chestnuts displaying symptoms of the disease . the findings have been published in the journal plos one . a visible symptom of the disease is a lesion on the bark , which oozes a resin on to the trunk or sometimes the branches . the bark underneath the canker is killed , and if cankers manage to go all the way around the trunk then the horse chestnut ( aesculus hippocastanum ) will die because it cuts off the food supply . the researchers sequenced the genome of the bacterium pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesuli ( pae ) from three samples collected from different locations within the uk . they compared them with samples from the only other recorded case , taken from an indian horse chestnut in india in the 1960s . " what we found was that the three british samples were all identical , " said co-author dr david studholme , currently at the university of exeter but who was based at the sainsbury laboratory , norwich , while during the study . " this means that they all probably descended from a single introduction , " he told bbc news . however , he added that more work was needed before they could say whether or not the bacterium originated from india , where the pathovar ( a strain of bacterium that only affects certain plants , in this case horse chestnuts ) was originally recorded . " the indian [ specimen ] has only ever been known to cause a leaf spot ; there is no evidence of it causing cankers . " dr studholme 's fellow co-author was sarah green , a plant pathologist at forest research , the research wing of the uk forestry commission . she said pae was " very mobile , very aggressive " and that it definitely needed to be studied . " there were some interesting genes that we found that may well be helping it to be so aggressive , " she explained . " it affects the woody part of the trees , whereas other bacterial diseases attack the soft tissues ( such as leaves ) . " however , she added that much more work was needed before it would be possible to understand how the
he also said drug laws would be changed so temporary bans could be introduced on " emerging substances " while scientific advice is sought . letters were also sent to councils and police forces in festival areas . mr brokenshire said : " during the festival season we know that people may be tempted to try potentially dangerous new drugs , particularly when they are advertised as ' legal ' or ' herbal ' . " that is why we are asking festival organisers and police to work with us to send out the message that these substances may not be safe and could contain illegal drugs . " we are going to change our drug laws so we can respond quickly to emerging substances by introducing a temporary ban while we seek full scientific advice . " some drugs previously sold as " legal highs " have now been banned , including mephedrone , now a class b drug . the home office said that the drug naphyrone is branded as nrg1 and sold as " plant food " or " bath salts " , but may contain one or more illegal drugs . the government said it will not permanently ban a substance without receiving full advice from the advisory council on the misuse of drugs . in the letter sent to festival organisers , mr brokenshire said : " as part of your preparations for this year 's event i ask you to review the measures you have put in place to ensure that your festival is as safe an environment as possible , to help protect the public , especially young people from the potential harms and risks of all drugs . " the government 's advice has been welcomed by melvin benn , managing director of festival republic , which stages the latitude , big chill and reading and leeds festivals . he said : " i can confirm that we do not allow legal high traders to trade at any festival republic festival and fully support the minister 's view . "
the conservative mp for rochester and strood told bbc radio kent : " i made a mistake . i 'm really sorry about it . " labour mp hazel blears said she returned to the library after it became " a bit lively " on the terrace . mr reckless is one of 227 new mps who started work at westminster following the general election on 6 may . he said : " i 'm terribly , terribly embarrassed . i apologise unreservedly and i do n't plan to drink again at westminster . " mr reckless denied claims that he fell asleep on the terrace or got a taxi back to his constituency . he added : " i remember someone asking me to vote and not thinking it was appropriate , given how i was at the time . " if i was in the sort of situation generally where i thought i was drunk i tend to go home . " westminster is a very special situation and all i can say ... is given this very embarrassing experience i do n't intend to drink at westminster again . " mr reckless was having drinks on the night of the second reading of the finance bill , which lasted until 0230 bst on wednesday . commons leader sir george young described it as the first " seriously late " sitting of the new parliamentary term . hazel blears told sky news on sunday : " on tuesday night , it was a hot night , and we all knew we were going to be there until two o'clock so i went out for a drink on the terrace . " i was there until about half past 10 . then i thought this is getting a bit lively so i went back in the library and did a bit more correspondence and then i popped out and had a drink somewhere else with my friends . " she added : " i think the lesson is [ that ] there 's a lot of new members in the house . he said , mr reckless , he said it was a bit like a lock - in so maybe he does that in his pub . " but i think he 's probably learnt his lesson . "
they had sought to be in the care of a male alternative bishop on terms acceptable to them . but the synod decided women bishops should be able to decide the identity and functions of any such bishop . the bbc 's religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said women bishops would have only to consult a code of practice guiding them in their dealings with traditionalists . he said the decision made during a synod meeting at york university had left a lot of division in its wake . members of the synod decided there was no need for further delay to the progress of a draft law allowing women to be made bishops . the law must now receive approval from a majority of the church 's 44 diocesan synods , before returning to the general synod . it must then receive a two - thirds majority at the general synod before receiving parliamentary approval and the royal assent . our correspondent said it had been an " extraordinary weekend of intense emotion " and although supporters were celebrating a breakthrough , some traditionalists had left the synod chamber in tears . proposals to create a class of male - only bishops to oversee traditionalist parishes were rejected on saturday . the archbishop of canterbury , rowan williams , and archbishop of york , john sentamu , had put their personal prestige behind the compromise plan , which would have allowed parishes unwilling to serve under a woman bishop to call upon the oversight of a male alternative . it would also have given that alternative bishop considerable legally - backed independence and autonomy as part of a " joint jurisdiction " over those parishes . although the proposal gained a majority of votes in the synod as a whole , it failed because clergy - who vote separately from lay people and bishops - defeated it by just five votes . our correspondent said dr williams had put his reputation on the line with the compromise plan and would now be in a difficult position as he tried to deal with discontent traditionalists who would probably stay in the church . the proposals will now go out to dioceses and return to the synod in a year 's time when there will be a final vote . campaigner christina rees , a member of the general synod and
they will be in the four border states , with arizona getting the largest share . a controversial new state law is due to come into effect in arizona on 29 july making it a crime to be in the state without without immigration papers . several lawsuits , including one by the federal government , have been filed challenging the legislation . the national guard troops would be fully operational by september , alan bersin , the commission of customs and border protection , told a news conference on monday . " the border is more secure and more resourced than it has ever been , but there is more to be done , " he said . in may , president obama announced that he would seek $ 500m ( Â£ 350m ) in new funding and deploy the troops to help secure the border . the soldiers , who will be armed but can only fire in self - defence , will mainly be deployed to observe suspicious movement along the border and will report to border patrol agents . they are to stay for a year , allowing time to hire and train more agents , officials said . arizona will receive 524 troops ; texas 250 , california 224 and new mexico 72 , while 130 will be part of a national liaison office . arizona governor jan brewer welcomed the administration 's efforts but said the deployment did not " appear to be enough or tied to a strategy to comprehensively defeat the increasingly violent drug and alien - smuggling cartels " that operate in arizona on a daily basis " . the new arizona legislation will require state and local officers to query the immigration status of people stopped for a legitimate reason who arouse suspicion of being in the us illegally . the arizona legislature says it was forced to act because the federal government failed to do so . the us justice department is challenging the law , arguing it as it usurps the federal administration 's authority to set immigration policy .
team members want to cut out as much of this cosmic ray interference as possible , even if it means moving the experiment 2 km below ground . this could help them positively identify the particles thought to make up dark matter . dr marek kos , who is a team member on the cryogenic dark matter search ii ( cdmsii ) project , outlined details at the international conference on high energy physics ( ichep ) in paris . he said the experiment could be relocated from a mine in minnesota to a deeper facility in ontario , canada . the matter we can see makes up just 17 % of matter in the universe ; the remaining 83 % is " dark " , meaning it does not reflect or emit detectable light . the existence of dark matter has been inferred through the gravitational pull it exerts on luminous galaxies and stars . though scientists have no idea what it consists of , one popular theory is that dark matter is made up of wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) . supporters of the idea believe a large number of wimps pass through the earth every second . but , because they interact only very weakly with normal matter , detecting them is difficult . experiments such as cdmsii measure large numbers of particle interactions in their detectors in the hope of spotting one caused by a wimp . cdmsii operates at extremely low temperatures and detects the energy released when particles hit atoms in germanium and silicon crystals within the detectors . cdmsii is currently housed at the soudan mine in minnesota . the experiment resides on the 27th level - some 2,341 ft below the surface . the original experiment was located in a tunnel on the stanford university campus in california . dr kos commented : " if we have another successful run at soudan , we 're planning to go even deeper , possibly - to the snolab in sudbury , ontario , in canada . " it is at 6,000 m water equivalent - a figure that 's used to compare it to other experiments - but it 's about 2 km underground . " going this deep would help reduce the background signals from cosmic ray muon particles . this effect can only be reduced by moving deeper underground .
people had travelled far to come to the festival . when the security stopped letting people in , they started pushing , so there was lots of pressure and screaming . i saw people going blue in the face . i was arguing with a guard to let the people in , but no amount of persuasion and reason could get through . it was a horrific display of mismanagement and stupidity . i 'm depressed beyond belief . this was a nightmare . i saw one girl they were trying to resuscitate and she had broken legs . her boyfriend was near her but there was nothing he could do . they put a cover over her in the end . this is the first time i have seen people die . someone needs to go for jail for this because people died for absolutely nothing . the moment i got there , i knew it was going to be a nightmare because there were too many people and the area was way too small . i lost my friends during the night but thankfully they 're all safe . i 'm on holiday and decided to go to the love parade spontaneously . the stampede reminded me of a heavy metal concert , only here , there was nobody to help . the number of people that i saw lying on the floor was ridiculous . they had stamp marks on their faces . it was n't until i saw people being resuscitated that i understood how serious this was . i do n't even know if they were alive or dead . simply unbelievable : the police and security personnel were more concerned with keeping people away from the edges , rather than helping them . we had one very tragic case [ here at duisburg 's bgu hospital ] . a young girl from italy was brought here , very disorientated , she said she had been momentarily unconscious , but was otherwise only slightly injured . she had lost all her hair and was missing her friend . she was here only for a short time to get looked after , and then she just waited here to be transferred to her hotel in oberhausen . while waiting here , she was informed by the police that her missing friend had indeed died in the
but these days china pours more money into this country than any other does . some of it is aid . some of it is investment . china 's people 's liberation army has handed over nearly $ 3m ( Â£ 1.95 m ) this year in aid to the mongolian military . at a signing ceremony at the defence ministry , senior officers from both countries toasted each other after two generals signed their latest agreement . everyone smiled . but some mongolians are suspicious of these close ties . they want to know what china really wants . they suspect their powerful neighbour is a bully , not a benefactor , and that such co-operation could , in time , start to undermine the mongolian way of life . the signs of their resentment are not hard to find . swastikas and slogans are daubed on walls across the city . on the internet the groups show how they are fighting back against what they see as attempts to dilute the mongolian race . a youtube video shows a man shaving the head of a mongolian woman . next to her a chinese man sits with his hands over his face . it is a very public warning to mongolian women . this is what happens if you sleep with chinese men . it was posted by a member of a far - right group called dayar mongol . erdenebileg zenemyadar is its founder . his group 's website shows members carrying nazi flags . the swastika is part of the group 's logo . however , he insists he is a nationalist , not a nazi . he comes to meet us in traditional dress - the kind of outfit nomadic herders wear out on the steppes . his organisation is blamed by human rights groups for dozens of attacks on women , foreigners and others they see as threatening the purity of their race . violence he condemns , but he defends the shaving of the woman 's head . " i think this is right , " he says . " if you ask the mongolian people what they think about it , the majority of people would support that act . " while he says his organisation does not order or sanction attacks , he offers this explanation for them . " young people
writing in a royal society journal , a team has named the creature that made them prorotodactylus . the prints are small - measuring a few centimetres in length - which suggests the earliest dinosaur - like animals were about the size of domestic cats . they would have weighed at most a kilogram or two , they walked on four legs and they were very rare animals . their footprints comprised only two or three per cent of the total footprints on this site . the footprints date to just two million years after the end - permian mass extinction - the worst mass extinction in the history of the planet . according to stephen brusatte , from the american museum of natural history in new york , who led the research : " in geological terms this is just the blink of an eye . " he told bbc news : " we can basically say that the dinosaur lineage originated in the immediate aftermath of this extinction which is a completely new idea and a very radical re-interpretation of the early history of dinosaurs " . in the end - permian extinction event , more than 90 % of all life on earth was wiped out due to massive volcanic eruptions , sudden global warming and the stagnation of the oceans . up until recently , scientists had thought that dinosaurs emerged 15 to 20 million years after the mass extinction , when the planet had become more habitable . but the new footprints suggest that the rise of dinosaurs was intimately related to the devastating extinction event . " without this mass extinction there would never have been dinosaurs , " said mr brusatte . " there 's a degree of symmetry about that because when dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago , that opened space for mammals , " he added . although the footprints are characteristic of dinosaur - like creatures , they do not provide the absolute proof that a fossilised skeleton would . " we 'd rather have a skeleton because footprints are a little open to interpretation , " professor mike benton , from bristol university , told bbc news . he believes that the discovery is important - but he says it would have been published in one of the top two scientific journals in the world if mr
they said the rodents lived significantly longer than other mice fed a normal diet . the research , reported in a scientific journal , has yet to be tried in people . the study leader said a large patient trial was needed to provide evidence to convince doctors . in experiments , middle - aged healthy male mice were given drinking water containing the amino acids leucine , isoleucine and valine . dr enzo nisoli , of the university of milan , and colleagues , said it increased the average lifespan of the mice by 12 % and boosted their fitness and co-ordination . they wrote in their paper , published in cell metabolism : " our study offers a rationale for deeply exploring the role of amino acids in prevention and control of age - related disorders in humans . " the amino acids - three of the 20 that make up proteins - have been shown to extend life span in yeast . however , the precise role of these amino acids in humans is unknown . they are used by bodybuilders to maintain muscle tissue and can be bought in health food stores and online .
the ceremony also celebrated the centenary of florence nightingale 's death and gave thanks for her work . as part of the service , a replica lamp of the one she took to the crimea was handed over from former nurses to current hospital staff . the window had originally been in two successive chapels in the derby royal infirmary and its nine panels were removed for restoration when that main hospital complex closed . former nurse pat crapper modelled for one of the images in 1959 . she said : " matron just came down one day with an architect and said ' stand still while they sketch your uniform ' - and when it went up it was me . " i 'm glad they 've managed it . it would be a shame to lose it , would n't it ? "
mr edwards said people who needed medical treatment may be denied a hospital bed as a result of the cuts . the department for health responded that an extra Â£ 2bn was being allocated to protect social care . health spending was ring - fenced in chancellor george osborne 's spending review . however , councils in england are facing a 27 % cut in central government funding over the next four years . mr edwards , whose organisation represents health service bodies in england , said the Â£ 2bn " interim solution to social care funding " announced in the spending review would be a " welcome relief to many " bur he said the funding squeeze could still have a " knock - on effect " on the health service . in his letter to the telegraph , mr edwards said : " less support from council services will quickly lead to increased pressure on emergency services and hospitals . " hospital beds will be blocked for those who badly need care because the support services the elderly require after discharge will not be available . " â¢ Â£ 81bn cut from public spending over four years â¢ 19 % average departmental cuts - less than the 25 % expected â¢ Â£ 7bn extra welfare cuts , including changes to incapacity , housing benefit and tax credits â¢ Â£ 1.8 bn increase in public sector pension employee contributions by 2014 â¢ rise in state pension age brought forward â¢ 7 % cut for local councils from april next year â¢ permanent bank levy â¢ rail fares to rise 3 % above inflation from 2012 he added : " when it comes to the care of the most vulnerable in our society , it really is essential that the nhs and local authorities are in it together . " the department of health said it understood that " social care can impact on nhs demands " . a spokeswoman said : " that 's why we are strengthening programmes like re-ablement and the 30 - day re-admission tariff , which will integrate hospital care with care in the community . " we have allocated an additional Â£ 2bn by 2014 - 15 - this extra boost , alongside an ambitious programme of efficiency , will ensure that there is enough funding available both to protect people 's access to
the last government ordered a private investigation , but refused a wider public inquiry . but in june the coalition government said the families of those who died deserved to know what went wrong . it is the fifth inquiry into the higher than expected deaths at stafford hospital between 2005 and 2008 . inquiry chairman robert francis qc , who will start hearing expert evidence next week , also chaired the fourth inquiry , which he criticised for its narrow remit . the inquiries were ordered after the 2009 healthcare commission report listed a catalogue of failings including receptionists assessing patients arriving at a&e , a shortage of nurses and senior doctors and pressure on staff to meet targets . patients ' left sobbing ' the start of monday 's inquiry was delayed after one of the relatives objected because family members and the media were in a different room from the inquiry chairman and his panel . in setting out the public inquiry framework mr francis said he would not revisit the harrowing cases of deceased patients brought to light in the fourth inquiry , which was held in private . instead he said he wanted to look at the structure of the nhs and the actions and inactions of management to see how the failings had come about and why they had remained undetected for so long . he also paid tribute to the relatives and campaigners from groups such as cure the nhs , which was set up to highlight problems at stafford hospital . he said everyone was there because of the " terrible standard of service inflicted on so many of the patients who went to stafford hospital and their families " . " last year , in my first inquiry , i sat and listened to many stories of appalling care , " he said . " as i did so , the question that went constantly through my mind was , why did none of the many organisations charged with the supervision and regulation of our hospital detect that something so serious was going on , and why was nothing done about it ? " tom kark qc , leading counsel to the inquiry , said the purpose of the inquiry was to focus not on what went wrong but how it was allowed to go on for so long . he
she died at pinderfields hospital . her 54 - year - old husband edward , who was driving , suffered injuries which were not thought to be life threatening . west yorkshire police said inquiries into the collision were continuing .
they also argued that a dedicated gaelic channel could play a major role in helping to safeguard the future of the language itself . uniquely for a bbc service within the uk , it is a joint venture . some of the programmes are paid for by the bbc - others are the responsibility of mg alba , funded by government money . however , there was disappointment once it became clear that the channel would only be broadcast on satellite tv - watched in 43 % of scottish homes - although programmes can also be accessed online through the bbc iplayer . supporters argued it was vital that the channel should also be broadcast on freeview , like all the other public service channels . bbc management came up with a plan which would make this possible . the downside was that it would mean that the bbc 's radio stations would have to come off freeview whenever bbc alba was on the air . the bbc trust put off a decision earlier this year as it was also due to carry out a wider review on how all bbc services should be broadcast . it has now backed the scheme after extensive research , although no date has been set for bbc alba 's appearance on freeview . some are hopeful it will be appear on freeview by the time the digital switchover takes place in central scotland next may and june . in practice , bbc alba will be available in almost every home in scotland and the challenge for the station will be to demonstrate that it can offer value to as many people as possible and appeal to viewers who can not speak gaelic . some newspaper commentators have claimed it is difficult for alba to show it is doing this , as normal viewing figures are not available for the station . instead , other forms of research have been used . it is understood one reason for this is that the sample used to compile normal ratings does not include viewers in the islands of scotland . although the bbc 's radio stations will no longer be broadcast on freeview once this happens , it is possible that they may return in the future as a result of technological improvements . despite this , the main radio stations will still be broadcast on
but in an open letter he urged the pm to " allow us to draw breath " and phase in plans to remove legal aid funding . the government said charities could not be immune from cuts but it aimed to open up new funding sources . mr cameron has championed the concept of the " big society " , which encourages greater personal and family responsibility and community activism . community links , an east london - based charity which provides welfare services , such as housing and debt advice , employment support and youth clubs , was praised by mr cameron as an " inspiring " organisation . mr robinson was among charity representatives invited to downing street to discuss it with the pm and deputy pm nick clegg after the general election . in his letter , he said he admired the prime minister 's " big hearted vision " and respected his " clear sighted perseverance " in pursuing it . but he said he was worried about the impact of spending cuts and that organisations like his , which should be the " bedrock of the big society " , were " wobbling " . mr robinson drew particular attention to changes to legal aid and the new deal which , he said , put most of community links ' budget for 2011 - 12 at risk . with big changes to the welfare system due to come in , he said the government had acknowledged there would be initial confusion - and expected agencies like his to provide support . " removing legal aid funding for advice on welfare benefits will wipe out agencies who would otherwise resolve these problems and there is next to no chance of local councils picking up the tab when most are stopping funding , not increasing it , " he said . he said many of the disadvantaged - particularly the elderly - would instead struggle on until they reached crisis point - illness or eviction . warning against a " barrage of uncoordinated cuts that hit the poorest hardest " he urged the pm to phase in planned cuts and do a " serious and urgent impact assessment " , giving groups more time to adjust . he proposed allowing legal aid to support groups giving advice until welfare reforms were " bedded down " .

data from sloan has helped to identify hundreds of millions of cosmic objects . the release was announced at the 217th annual meeting of the american astronomical society in seattle , us . researchers have released an animation on youtube demonstrating how the incredibly high - resolution image is represented on the celestial sphere . michael blanton , a new york university physicist who presented the work on behalf of the sloan team , told the conference that it was difficult to overstate the breadth of data sloan provided . " there 's something like 3,500 papers that have been written on the basis of this data set , " he said . " a few dozen of them are being presented right now , this week at this meeting . they cover topics from the very smallest stars to the most massive black holes in the universe . " nearly half a billion stars and galaxies have already been discovered and described thanks to sloan images , and the new release is sure to significantly increase that number . sloan data is also behind the google sky service , which allows users to scan the heavens in the same way as scanning their local streets , and the galaxy zoo project , which has allowed astronomy enthusiasts to characterise galaxies from their own computers . the workhorse behind the data set , a camera comprising 125 million pixels that long held the record for highest - resolution camera in the world , has been retired . studies will now focus on spectrometry - unpicking new data on the basis of the colours of light that the upgraded equipment can detect . they include : but even the data that is already available , thanks to tuesday 's release , will keep astronomers of both the professional and the amateur variety busy . " you can compare it to the national geographic palomar survey of the late 1950s , " dr blanton said . " this is something that 50 years later is still a really important reference to astronomers ; we use it ourselves to better understand our own images . sdss is the digital version of that . "
the funeral was held at st malachy 's in ballymacilroy , county tyrone , the church in which she married john mcareavey on 30 december . irish president mary mcaleese and other dignitaries attended . shattered happiness they included northern ireland 's deputy first minister martin mcguinness , as well as sporting and political figures . symbols representing mrs mcareavey 's " beauty , her faith , love of family and the irish language " were presented at the beginning of the service . the service was led by mr mcareavey 's uncle , bishop john mcareavey , who married the couple . primate of the catholic church in ireland sean brady also took part in the service . it took almost 10 minutes for the massive crowd to file into the chapel and grounds behind michaela mcareavey 's coffin . as the cortege came over the hill towards the chapel , mourners outside fell utterly silent . just birdsong and the sound of rushing water from the river broke the quiet . at the start of the mass , family members presented symbols of michaela and her life including a pioneer pin , rosary beads and a family photograph . bishop mcareavey said that people would want to hold onto the memory of the " special day " of the couple 's wedding rather than the day of mrs mcareavey 's death last week . " at their wedding , everyone could see the glow of happiness that radiated from michaela and john , " he added . he said an " evil act " had happened in mauritius that " shattered happiness and dreams for the future " and that nothing could have prepared his nephew john for the ordeal that followed . a marquee for 300 people was erected in the church grounds to cope with some of the overspill from the 400 - capacity building . many more people were watching from surrounding areas and a large screen was set up to allow them to view the service . in the northern ireland assembly , first minister peter robinson asked mlas to observe a short period of reflection , describing the murder as " an enormous human tragedy " . he added : " the loss is even more harrowing as it was a beautiful young woman on her honeymoon . " i feel we all
here 's a timeline of the main developments since the inquiry , under sir john chilcot 's leadership , began in july 2009 . the report will be published on wednesday 6 july , it is announced . sir john chilcot says national security vetting has been completed and that no sections of the report will either be removed or redacted . he confirms that the report will be 2.6 million words long and that families of the 179 british service personnel and civilians killed in iraq will have the chance to read it before it is published . it later emerges that the full report will cost Â£ 787 to purchase while the 150 - page executive summary will cost Â£ 30 . chilcot report to be published on 6 july sir john chilcot says , in a letter written to prime minister david cameron , that he expects to finish the report - which will be more than two million words long - by april 2016 . he says that allowing for national security checking the pm should be in a position to publish the report in " june or july 2016 " . in his latest update , sir john chilcot said the process of giving witnesses subject to criticisms in the report the right to reply had yet to be completed , with some individuals yet to respond . until this happened , he said he could not set out a " realistic timetable " for when the report would be completed but hoped to do so as soon as possible . in response , david cameron expressed his " disappointment " and said he was " fast losing patience " over the time being taken . he has asked the cabinet secretary sir jeremy heyward to meet with sir john to discuss the issues involved . appearing before the foreign affairs select committee , sir john chilcot says he will not give any timetable for publication as he does not want to " arouse false hopes " . he says the process of giving witnesses criticised in the draft report the right to respond is the primary obstacle standing in the way of completing its work . he says he is not aware of any individuals holding up the process by taking an undue length of time to respond to his findings . he also
a court in hawaii found him guilty in august of passing on information which helped china to design a stealth cruise missile . prosecutors had hoped for a life sentence but said 32 years was " in many ways appropriate " . gowadia was accused of travelling to china between 2003 and 2005 while designing the missile . he was said to have been paid $ 110,000 ( Â£ 69,000 ) - money that was used to pay off a mortgage on a luxury home on the island of maui . his defence had argued that he only provided information which was unclassified and freely available . but chief us district judge susan oki mollway said gowadia " broke his oath of loyalty " to the us . " he was found guilty of marketing valuable technology to foreign countries for personal gain , " she told reporters . assistant us attorney ken sorenson said he was " a little disappointed " that a life sentence was not given . " but 32 years is stiff and in many ways an appropriate sentence for him , " he said . " we 're confident the message is sent that when you compromise us national security , when you disclose national defence secrets , when you profit by us national defence information , that you will be punished , you will be pursued , you will be convicted . " gowardia 's family said the defence intended to appeal against the sentence . " my father would never , ever do anything to intentionally hurt this country , " the associated press news agency quoted his son ashton as saying . " we hope the convictions will be overturned and he 'll be able to go home . "
it warns that lonely older people are at increased risk of depression , lack of exercise and bad diet . the campaign says that almost one in 10 elderly people suffers from " intense " loneliness . the campaign group wants loneliness to be recognised as a public health issue - and has published a survey claiming that fewer than one in five people is aware of the link between poor health and loneliness . the campaign has been set up by independent age , age uk oxfordshire , counsel and care and wrvs and funded by the calouste gulbenkian foundation . while people are aware of the emotional problems of loneliness , the campaign says few recognise the physical damage . it warns of elderly people trapped in their own homes by a lack of mobility and the loss of family and friends . a lack of social interaction can make old people more vulnerable to depression and to problems such as excessive drinking , poor diet and a reduction in exercise . the campaigners say that " loneliness adversely affects the immune and cardio - vascular systems " and a lack of social interaction is linked to the onset of alzheimer 's disease . " the problems of loneliness and isolation need to be put on an equal footing with any other condition associated with ageing . ending loneliness should be part of the solution to the challenge of reforming care and support , " said campaign director laura ferguson . the campaign wants to highlight the importance of loneliness in the lives of the elderly . more than half of people over the age of 75 are living alone - and about one in 10 says he or she suffers from " intense " loneliness . according to the campaign , almost one in five old people sees family , friends or neighbours less than once a week - and about one in 10 of them experiences such social interaction less than once a month . a spokeswoman for the campaign says that there is a need for informal and formal attempts to tackle such loneliness , either through organised befriending schemes or through neighbours helping one another . she said that it was a problem that was often overlooked and which could manifest itself in other ways , such as health problems .
asked about the issue at prime minister 's questions , mr cameron said the last government had made progress on the issue , but more had to be done . he agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak english . conservative mp for keighley kris hopkins asked if the pm agreed that there was " a responsibility and an obligation " on parents to make sure their children can speak english when they start school . mr cameron replied : " i completely agree ... in too many cases this is n't happening . " since last autumn , people from outside the eu applying for a visa to join their spouse or partner now have to prove they have a basic command of english before their application is approved . previously , visa applicants had to show only that their marriage or partnership was genuine and that they could financially support themselves . the prime minister told the commons : " the last government did make some progress on making sure people learnt english when they came to our country , i think we need to go further . " if you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives , particularly from the indian sub-continent , we should be putting in place - and we will be putting in place - tougher rules to make sure they do learn english and so when they come , if they come , they can be more integrated into our country . " the weekly session of prime minister 's questions was dominated by foreign affairs with labour leader ed miliband focusing all his six questions on events in egypt and the uk 's mission in afghanistan . mr miliband , who visited afghanistan for the first time as labour leader last week , paid an extended tribute to soldiers ' work there , acknowledged the difference in the commons session from the normal political point scoring . mr cameron welcomed the opportunity to have a " serious conversation " about the work of british soldiers in afghanistan , saying they wanted politicians to discuss their efforts , although he also noted many mps often " preferred a bunfight " about domestic issues .
the public inquiry 's finding 's will not be released until three prosecutions in connection with the case have concluded . the government said the report had been placed in a secure location . last month , ni secretary of state , owen paterson , announced the report delay . the inquiry began its public hearings in january 2009 and held closing submissions in december 2009 . it heard evidence in person from 174 witnesses and witness statements from a further 37 witnesses . mr hamill , a father - of - three , suffered serious head injuries and died 11 days after the attack .
but he did not get the necessary approval for 89 studies . he has been suspended , and is now being investigated for research fraud . however , a uk expert said patients should not worry , as the work was not fundamental to how colloids are used . dr boldt worked as chief anaesthetist at the klinikum ludwigshafen hospital in rhineland . in an open letter , published this week , the editors of the journals , including anaesthesia and the british journal of anaesthesia , said 89 of 102 studies published by him were not found to have approval from an institutional review board ( irb ) in germany . the retraction of the articles " means the research was unethical , and that irb approval for the research was misrepresented in the published article , " the letter said . but it added : " it does not mean the research results per se are fraudulent . " the hospital where dr boldt worked is now checking the research against patient and laboratory records . any findings of " data fabrication , falsification , or misrepresentation " will then be communicated to readers , the letter said . eleven of the articles were published in the british journal of anaesthesia . the journal 's editor , professor charles reilly , said all 11 of dr boldt 's studies published in the bja claimed to have ethics approval but that later emerged not to be true . dr boldt 's work was used to inform british guidelines on intravenous fluid use . references to his work are being removed . but dr rupert pearse , senior lecturer and consultant in intensive care medicine at barts & the london medical school , who helped put together the guidelines , said the general message about the use of colloids - including the risks and benefits to be considered for individual patients - would not change . he added : " the most important point is that there are no immediate safety concerns for patients because these studies are small and they are not fundamental to how doctors use intravenous fluid in clinical practice . " he told the bbc that dr boldt 's findings were in line with the work of other researchers which was not being questioned , so the approach to using colloids would remain the same .
ballot boxes were at the usual election points in the town and votes were being cast from 1600 until 2100 gmt . the count was taking place at council offices with the results , which are non-binding on the government , due to be announced later in the night .
bbc news website readers in france have been sending in their reaction to this story . here is a selection of their comments . in my opinion , the law appears to be against individual liberties . i am a muslim but i do n't wear a head scarf as i think it 's not faithful to my principles . however , this ban will certainly stigmatise islam . this practice concerns a small number of muslim women in france and in that way it appears extreme and unfair , because these women will tend to be confined at home most of the time . the consequences will be socially disastrous . through this law you can see that islam in france is perceived as a threat to french values and society . sabrina , lille , france as a muslim living in paris , i 'm so glad that this new law is here , for there has been a growing problem for some time now in paris , with the radicalisation of young muslims . some of the more extreme muslims have begun to use dress as a symbol or statement against french society . i feel that the extreme example of the muslim faith works against all that muslims in france stand for . that is , that we can live in harmony side by side with other religions and faiths . jean paul baptiste , paris , france at last a law that protects the dignity and the human rights of women . this is not a racist law , it is a brave and progressive law that aims to put an end to the scandalous persecution of women in the muslim community . i am not sarkozy 's biggest fan and i wish someone else was leading my country , but i support this law 100 % as the plight of women having to wear this garment around the world really saddens me . rachel sword , aix en provence , france i agree with this law . the women who walk around in public in the burqa , cause feelings of both fear , and pity . i have often heard that these women complain of being totally ignored by those around them - hardly surprising , really . hiding your identity causes others to become wary and suspicious . fiona ricard , gailhan
amanda dowler , known as milly , was a " pretty , popular and intelligent " 13 - year - old girl . " to all intents and purposes she was an ordinary girl who was developing into a fine young woman , " prosecutor brian altman told the old bailey . milly lived in walton with her parents bob and sally and older sister gemma , who the court heard she was close to . gemma told the court : " we would go to bed at the same time and lie in the room chatting about our day . milly and i did n't have any secrets and she would tell me about boys at school she fancied . " milly liked gareth gates and had seen him at a pop idol concert a few days before she died . she had been looking forward to an upcoming school gig , where she was due to see a boy she liked . but the court also heard there was another side to her , as poems and a " goodbye " letter were found after her death , suggesting she was unhappy . milly was in year 9 at heathside school in weybridge , where her mother sally taught maths . it was only by chance that she took the route home which saw her cross bellfield 's path - she would normally have got off at another station but had gone to a cafe with friends . " she was one of the funniest people i had ever met . she was always trying to make people laugh and smile , " her friend danielle sykes said . marsha mcdonnell , 19 , had completed her a-levels and was taking a gap year before starting university when she died . described in court as an " attractive blonde " , she was attacked by bellfield just yards from the hampton home she shared with her parents , phil and ute , her two sisters and younger brother . ms mcdonnell , who was working in a gift shop in kingston , had visited the cinema with friends on the night she was attacked . her sister nathalie said : " she always thought of other people . she was a free spirit . " speaking after the verdict , her uncle , shane mcdonnell , said :
the injured were taken to hospital . no group has so far said it was behind the bombing . the attack came just hours after the nigerian president , goodluck jonathan , was sworn in for his first full term of office in the capital , abuja . a second , smaller explosion hit a beer parlour in zuba , on the outskirts of abuja , causing minor injuries , officials say . the cause is not yet known . the blasts at the mamy market , near the shadawanka barracks , happened at about 2030 ( 1930 gmt ) . officials said it was " powerful " . " there were lots of people since it 's a sunday evening . people were relaxing , eating and drinking , " bauchi state police commissioner abdulkadir indabawa said . army barracks in nigeria sometimes contain small market areas where traders sell food , drink and other goods to soldiers and civilians . all roads leading to the barracks were cordoned off by security personnel after the blast . the police say five people were killed , although sources at a hospital told the bbc that they had seen at least 10 bodies and there were possibly more . the bbc 's jonah fisher in abuja says no - one has yet claimed to be behind the attack , though the timing - on the day of president jonathan 's inauguration - could mean a link with widespread northern anger at his election . mr jonathan was promoted from vice-president after northerner umaru yar ' adua died in office in 2010 . april 's election was largely considered free and fair , but hundreds of people were killed in three days of rioting and reprisal killings in northern towns following the announcement of the result . mr jonathan secured nearly 60 % of the vote in the election . his main challenger , northern muslim and former military ruler muhammadu buhari , came a distant second with almost 32 % . analysts say that mr jonathan will have to tackle the continuing christian - muslim conflict and also the simmering tension in the oil - producing niger delta . " we will not allow anyone to exploit differences in creed or tongue to set us one against another , " mr jonathan said in a speech at his inauguration ceremony .

plans to extend the uk electricity grid out as far as ireland are on the agenda at the diplomatic meeting in london . chief minister tony brown said if this happens the isle of man could be well placed to benefit . he said : " we are mid way between england and ireland and therefore there is a potential renewable energy opportunity . " i think it is very early days yet but it will be interesting to hear what is being proposed and how we can be an active party in that . " tynwald has committed to having 15 % of the island 's electricity generated from renewable sources by 2015 . but a plan for wind farms in the west of the island faced stiff opposition from residents . mr brown said if energy could be brought in from an irish wind farm the island could avoid building turbines close to the manx coast . " we are of course conscious that a wind farm could create renewable energy for the island but we are also aware of the impact that may have visually . " the isle of man government is also hoping a planned wind farm development by centrica will lead to further expansion of wind power . energy minister john shimmin has said the company 's plans site turbines about 12 miles off the island in 2015 could facilitate a further manx development in about 2018 .
communities faced a severe health risk , with some families drinking water with high levels of carcinogens , it said . oil giant shell has accepted liability for two spills and said all oil spills were bad for nigeria and the company . " we will continue working with our partners in nigeria , including the government , to solve these problems and on the next steps to help clean up ogoniland , " mutiu sunmonu , managing director of the shell petroleum development company of nigeria ( spdc ) , said in a statement . the bodo fishing community has said it will seek hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation . nigeria is one of the world 's major oil producers . the un assessment of ogoniland , which lies in the niger delta , said 50 years of oil operations in the region had " penetrated further and deeper than many had supposed " . by peter okwochebbc news during a visit to a village in ogoniland in 2007 , i went to a small stream that gave people water for all their daily needs . the effects of oil spillage were clear . on the surface of the water there was a thin film of oil . villages moved it with their hands before scooping water . villagers told me no fish had been seen in the stream for more than five years . they told me people had been killed by oil pipes exploding and others had developed health problems after inhaling fumes from burning oil well heads . when i visited the village again in 2011 , oil spillage had worsened . villagers no longer drank water from the stream . they walked for up to four hours to get water . over the past two decades , successive nigerian governments have failed the people of ogoniland . i doubt this report will change anything . in the meantime , the voices of secession in ogoniland will grow louder . " in at least 10 ogoni communities where drinking water is contaminated with high levels of hydrocarbons , public health is seriously threatened , " the un environmental programme ( unep ) said in a statement . some areas which appeared unaffected were actually " severely contaminated " underground , unep said . in one community , the report says , families were drinking
innovating beyond oil planes trains and roaming charges to the outsider it looks like any other ageing factory . in the dank , strip - light lit interior there are rows of disused machines with cogs wrapped in cobwebs . but three years ago the factory became the focus of the world 's media , when it became apparent it was the last in the palestinian territories to produce the keffiyeh , the traditional arab headdress and favourite of former leader yasser arafat . the palestinian keffiyeh industry had suffered a slump following market liberalisation measures under the 1993 oslo accords . wholesalers in the palestinian territories increasingly bought cheaper versions of the scarf from china , jordan and syria . a hirbawi textiles scarf costs around $ 6 , while a chinese keffiyeh costs as little as $ 3 . for loom worker abdel aziz el taraki the move signalled the demise of the family run business . set up in 1961 , the factory started with just two weaving machines , but as the headscarf became synonymous with palestinian nationalism , demand quickly rose . " of course business used to be much better . we used to have 15 machines working and it was n't enough , we sometimes had to work for 24 hours to cover the demand , " says el taraki . " in the 1980s , during the first intifada , production was covering everywhere from gaza to jerusalem and ramallah . every imported keffiyeh sold here means one less sold for us . " in the past we were doing very well , it then deteriorated until we only had two machines working in the factory . " following the media attention came a flood of inquiries about the factory . capitalising on the public 's interest , the hirbawi family set up an web page so orders from foreign countries could be placed . around the same time the story had caught the eye of the ' young professionals for palestine ' , a group of internet activists based at the time in kuwait . group founder noora kassem says they were concerned foreign imports were destroying the meaning of the palestinian scarf . " globalisation has allowed cheaper products to be made in other countries that actually care nothing about the identity of the product itself and one of the
the government in damascus says it is tackling armed terrorist gangs . more than 1,700 people have reportedly died in the six - month uprising against the rule of president bashar al - assad . the ramel quarter and neighbouring areas are said to be under constant heavy gunfire on monday as tanks and troops move through the streets . the assault began on saturday , a day after mass anti-government protests in the city . by jim muirbbc news , beirut latakia was one of the cities to be caught up in the revolt soon after it erupted in mid-march . despite repeated attempts by the regime to stifle defiance , it keeps breaking out . it is a sensitive city . its population is 600,000 or so , and it has a sunni muslim majority , as does the country , but there are also areas dominated by president assad 's minority alawite community . the current punishment is being meted out to mainly sunni areas , a fact that could further aggravate sectarian tensions already sensitised by the situation . on sunday , activists said syrian warships had joined the attack , firing shells on the city . one resident of ramel told associated press news agency : " we are being targeted from the ground and the sea . the shooting is intense . we can not go out . they are raiding and breaking into people 's homes . " he said that at least three gunboats were taking part and mosques had been targeted . a syrian military official on monday denied as " absolutely baseless " reports that gunboats had fired on latakia , syria 's official sana news agency reported . a uk - based anglican priest who is visiting his family in latakia said the atmosphere in the city was extremely tense . " [ on sunday ] you could hear a lot of shooting and bombing from different parts of the city , " the reverend nadim nassar told the bbc . " the whole city is now shut ... the fear is very high and people do n't know what 's going on and what is next , " he said . the london - based syrian observatory for human rights said at least one young child had been killed . state television denied any shelling had happened .
gloucestershire 's bid focused on gloucester and cinderford . but communities minister bob neill said the county could still benefit from other job - creating projects . " it 's no disgrace to gloucestershire at all , they did hard work , i know that , " he said . " and what i 'd say to them is do not be discouraged . " we are working with local enterprise partnerships and local councils beyond the enterprise zone projects , for example giving councils the ability to discount business rates to attract businesses into the area , giving the ability to set up simplified planning regimes . " plans for 21 nationwide zones were first set out in march 's budget . zones have been confirmed for sites in cheshire , cornwall , gosport , norfolk , hereford , kent and oxfordshire . other locations include essex , suffolk , northampton , leicestershire , cambridgeshire and the humber estuary . ministers said 30,000 new jobs would be created by 2015 by giving cheaper business rates , super-fast broadband and lower levels of planning control .
but suspicious neighbours confronted the couple and reported them to police . the two women are now back with their families , forcibly separated and under surveillance by the islamic police . the local sharia police chief told them islam said they must be beheaded and burned for what they had done . but aceh , the only province in indonesia that is allowed to implement sharia law , has yet to adopt any provisions dealing with gay and lesbian people . the provincial parliament passed islamic laws authorising the stoning to death of adulterers and the caning of homosexuals in 2009 , but the governor has refused to sign it . homosexuality is frowned upon but legal in indonesia . activists have blamed aceh 's sharia laws for encouraging vigilantism and intolerance , and say they violate the indonesian constitution .

the birds hang upside down from this perch and fertilise the plant when they thrust their beaks into the red flowers to drink nectar . the international team reports the findings in the annals of botany . plants go to great lengths to attract animals to pollinate them ; they seduce insects , birds and small mammals with colourful , shapely , sweet - smelling flowers . some plants even wave at passing pollinators . on first seeing the deep red , long - tubular flowers of babiana ringens in 2003 , botanist spencer barrett from the university of toronto , canada , suspected that he was dealing with a plant that was pollinated exclusively by birds . but the position of the flowers at the base of the plant perplexed him . most birds avoid feeding on or close to the ground to keep clear of ground - dwelling predators ; plants reliant on bird - pollination tend to keep their flowers up high . dr barrett and his colleague bruce anderson from university of stellenbosch in south africa , wondered if the curious perch - like structure had evolved to give pollinating birds a foothold from which to feed . crouching among the shrubs of the cape of south africa , binoculars in hand , dr barrett and his team confirmed that the flowers were exclusively pollinated by sunbirds . " when we saw a bird visiting we were completely enchanted , " said dr barrett . still unconvinced that the stick - like protrusion had evolved as a perch , the team set about to gather further evidence . they set out to look at the full distribution of b. ringens across the cape , and found that in the east , where sunbirds have a greater variety of flowering plants to choose between , b. ringens ' perches were smaller than in the west , where plants can rely on regular visits from sunbirds . dr barrett suspects that in the absence of pollinating birds , the plants do not need to invest in maintaining the perch , and so it shrinks over many generations - an example of what is called relaxed selection . with time , this branch might return to its ancestral form , which the researchers suspect was a central stem with flowers at its top , much like many of b.

aircraft currently in the air will complete their flights , but there will be no further departures . chief executive alan joyce called his decision " unbelievable " . fair work australia , the national industrial tribunal , adjourned a hearing on the qantas dispute on saturday night . the tribunal - which has the power to suspend or terminate industrial action - is to reconvene later on sunday . australian prime minister julia gillard has warned that the dispute could have " implications " for the national economy . the airline has been hit by a series of costly strikes . baggage handlers , engineers and pilots have been involved in the action which the company says is costing a$ 15m ( us$ 16m ) a week . the airline issued a statement on its facebook page saying customers booked on qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice . the airline said a full refund would be available to those affected . relations between the unions and qantas management started deteriorating in august after the airline announced plans for restructuring and moving some operations to asia . by phil mercerbbc news , sydney at the heart of the dispute are concerns about pay and job security along with cost - cutting and the subcontracting of work overseas as qantas looks to set up new airlines in asia and sack hundreds of staff to revive its sagging international fortunes . at sydney international airport , feelings among marooned passengers oscillated between anger and frustration . qantas ' decision to pull its entire international and domestic fleets from the skies comes during one of australia 's busiest travel weekends , with tens thousands of people converging on the hugely popular melbourne cup horse race , an event that stops the nation for a few , brief minutes . anger and dismay at qantas move qantas grounded : your stories qantas has a 65 % share of the domestic australian market , but has been making heavy losses on its international flights . the restructuring is expected to mean the loss of 1,000 jobs from its 35,000 - strong workforce . the disruption to flights has also affected a meeting of commonwealth heads of government in perth , with reports that members from 17 delegations have been stranded in the city because of the dispute . it comes
raised by his grandparents in grenada in poverty , dr murray worked his way up to become a successful cardiologist in the us . a series of financial and personal problems seemed to be ending after a chance meeting in las vegas with michael jackson led to a once - in - a-lifetime opportunity . dr murray was hired at jackson 's request to be the star 's personal physician ahead of his 50 - date series of london concerts , this is it . raised by his maternal grandparents , dr murray proved a hard - working student , eventually following his absent father , also a doctor , to the us - where he enrolled at texas southern university . he graduated three years later with a degree in pre-medicine and biological sciences . he continued his medical studies in nashville , tennessee , before completing his training in california and the university of arizona , where he studied cardiology . in 2000 , he opened his own practice in las vegas , expanding with a second clinic in houston in 2006 . like his father , he took pride serving both ends of the community , and provided medical care to deprived areas . however , dr murray 's apparent success was blighted by outstanding debts and tax demands . reports suggest he filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while living in california . the doctor 's financial problems stemmed by providing medical care for the poor , his lawyers have said . he had not paid the mortgage on his home in months when jackson offered him the job as his personal physician . other unpaid bills and debts loomed . dr murray met michael jackson when the singer 's daughter , paris , was sick during a family trip to las vegas in 2006 . according to dr murray 's spokeswoman , someone within jackson 's group knew the doctor and called dr murray to treat her . they remained friendly and jackson hired the physician in may 2009 . he was to be paid $ 150,000 ( Â£ 96,000 ) a month . " as a company , we would have preferred not having a physician on staff full - time because it would have been cheaper ... but michael was insistent that he be hired , " promoter aeg 's randy phillips told the
the spyware is believed to have been designed to steal data to help launch further cyber attacks . the sender has not been identified , but researchers have found a reference to a us television programme in duqu 's code . the iranian news agency , irna , reported that the country 's cyber defence unit was taking steps to combat the infection . " the software to control the virus has been developed and made available to organisations and corporations , " brigadier general gholamreza jalali , head of iran 's civil defence body , is quoted as saying . " all the organisations and centres that could be susceptible to being contaminated are being controlled . " mr jalali said a " final report " into which organisations had been targeted was still being worked on . last year the iranian government accused the west of trying to disrupt its nuclear facilities using the stuxnet worm computer attack . then in april 2011 officials said the country 's facilities had been targeted by a second piece of malware dubbed " stars " . officials now describe the duqu attack as the " third virus " to hit iran . the computer security specialist kaspersky lab said it believed that " stars " was a keylogging program that may have been part of the same attack that installed duqu . keylogging programs are able to collect information about a computer system , take screenshots , search for files and capture passwords . the firm also provided more detail about how duqu worked based on its analysis of other targets . it said another unidentified company received an email from an individual identifying himself as mr b jason who requested a joint business venture . the firm believed this was a reference to the jason bourne books and spy movies . the recipient was asked to open a microsoft word attachment that referenced the targeted company 's name in its title , and thus did not appear to be spam . it said that for every victim a separate set of attack files was created using a different control server . the firm said this happened at least 12 times . when the addressee opened the file the malware became active through a truetype font exploit , but did nothing until it detected that there had been no keyboard or
after disagreement between the parties in the wake of the cash - for - honours scandal , this all sounded rather encouraging . a few weeks later , the independent committee on standards in public life thought the issue worthy of investigation and began an inquiry . the chairman , sir christopher kelly , admitted that " significant difficulties remain " but he was encouraged to aver that " there is sufficient will to reform the system to give us some hope that it ought to be possible to find a solution " . in the lingua franca of whitehall , that is gutsy , optimistic stuff . sir christopher 's cup was not just half full , it was positively brimming over with hope . now , after a delay of many months , we have learned the fruits of sir christopher 's endeavour . he is proposing a Â£ 10,000 cap on individual donations to political parties . he also proposed that union members should be required to decide individually whether or not they want to give money to the labour party . currently they have to opt out if they do not want their cash to end up in ed miliband 's coffers . in return for these two measures that would substantially reduce the income of the three largest parties , sir christopher is recommending that the public should dig into their own pockets and contribute to the funding of political parties themselves . the parties with mps - or representation in the scottish parliament or welsh and northern ireland assemblies - would get something in the region of Â£ 3 for each vote cast in their favour . at the last general election , about 30 million of us bothered to vote . so the plan would theoretically provide a cool Â£ 90m to be distributed among the parties over the course of a five - year parliament . that is quite a lot of cash . the public would also be able to give a large chunk of money to a party without paying tax . the trouble is that no one appears to agree with this . the conservative member of the committee , oliver heald , has written a dissenting view setting out his opposition to a Â£ 10,000 cap . the tories would prefer Â£ 50,000 . they would also like
it is near the comedian 's birthplace , overlooks the shipyards where he once worked as a welder and can be seen from the kingston bridge . connolly said he was " humbled " by the artwork . " it is an unexpected honour for which i am extremely grateful , " he said . sanctuary scotland housing association commissioned the 500 kg ( 79st ) mural which formally completes phase 1 of the regeneration project . connolly , 68 , said : " i consider myself a citizen of the world , but i was born and raised in glasgow - it is where my first children were born - where i learnt to play the banjo - where i served my apprenticeship as a welder , and where i first performed in public . " my heart beats to the rhythm of glasgow - it is in my blood . " i am happy and humbled that sanctuary scotland housing association commissioned a mural of me , to be erected in my home city , and thrilled that it was so skillfully created by artist and master craftsman andy scott . " mr scott said : " we 're delighted mr connolly likes the mural as it 's been a long and challenging commission . " it 's been interesting capturing a living legend but mr connolly never interfered and very quickly gave the finished artwork his blessing . " he said he had tried to capture the comedian in his early days to reflect his roots in the city . mr scott 's early sketches were hand - drawn in pencil on a giant timber wall in his workshop , which replicated the gable end in anderston . once he was happy with the drawing , it became the template for the steel mural . it is made from about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) of 6 mm ( 0.24 in ) steel , chopped into thousands of pieces . each piece was individually placed and welded to create the image . if the pieces were laid end - to - end , they would stretch from billy 's birthplace in anderston beyond glasgow city chambers . mr scott 's other works include the heavy horse sculpture on the m8 and the 33ft mermaid on the a80 at cumbernauld . " the method used was different
new fishing limits would be imposed and and exploration for oil and gas banned . the proposal is subject to a 90 - day consultation , but mr burke said the coral sea 's biodiversity was at the heart of the plan . " there is no other part of australia 's territory where so much comes together - pristine oceans , magnificent coral , a military history which has helped define us and now a clear proposal for permanent protection , " he said . the sea - off the queensland coast in north - east australia - is home to sharks and tuna , isolated tropical reefs and deep sea canyons . it is also the resting place of three us navy ships sunk in the battle of the coral sea in 1942 . under the plans , fishing - commercial and recreational - would be allowed in some areas of the reserve , which at its closest point would start 60 km ( 37 miles ) from the coast and it extends out to 1,100 km . president of the queensland seafood industry association geoff tilton said a larger area was needed for commercial fishing . but professor terry hughes , director of coral reef studies at james cook university , called the proposal a " welcome step " that " cements australia 's reputation as a world leader in marine resource management " . " the proposed coral sea no - take area is hundreds of kilometres offshore , and will have no impact on recreational fishing . there is very , very little commercial fishing currently operating legally in the coral sea today , " he said . activists called the plan a good start but said key reefs and spawning grounds lay outside the fully protected area . currently the world 's largest marine reserve is a 545,000 - sq - km area ( 210,425 sq miles ) established by the uk around the chagos islands in the indian ocean . the coral sea reserve , if approved , would be approximately 989,842 sq km .
it is now one in three , compared with one in 10 in 2005 . children with their own books were more likely to be above - average readers and do better at school , the study of 18,000 children suggested . poorer children and boys were less likely to have books , it added . the survey was carried out in september with school - aged children from 111 schools across the uk . it suggested that a third ( 33.2 % ) did not have books of their own . that translates to 3.8 m children uk - wide . better off children and young people were more likely to say they had books of their own , compared with those who received free school meals . trust director jonathan douglas said the steep rise in the number of children without their own books was of particular concern . he said : " we know there is a direct correlation between book ownership and children 's reading abilities . " with one in 6 in the uk struggling with literacy it is very worrying that many children could be missing out on opportunities to develop these essential skills . " the trust said that children who owned books were more likely than others to read every day , and that book ownership had a clear link with reading ability . of the children and young people with books of their own , more than half read above the level expected for their age , with fewer than one in 10 reading below the level . by contrast , among those without books of their own , nearly a fifth were failing to meet the expected reading level , with only a third reading above that level . the trust launched the survey to coincide with an appeal for public donations towards books and reading support for disadvantaged children . a number of children 's book illustrators have designed cards to support the trust 's christmas gift of reading campaign . the survey also revealed links between reading ability and receiving books as presents . about a fifth of children said they had never been to a book shop or a library . but the survey also showed that reading any type of material , for example magazines , outside class at least once a month was also associated

for japan , 2011 was dominated by the earthquake and tsunami in march . the disasters led to unprecedented numbers of japanese helping one another . after the tsunami smashed into japan 's north - east coast on 11 march , killing thousands and engulfing entire communities , people 's stoicism and their determination to pull together won international praise . in april the then prime minister naoto kan thanked the world for its help in a letter entitled " kizuna - the bonds of friendship " . and when japan unexpectedly beat the united states to win the women 's football world cup , " kizuna " forged by the players ' teamwork was cited with pride . half a million people took part in the annual poll for the kanji character , conducted by japan 's kanji aptitude testing foundation . about 60,000 people nominated " kizuna " , but the runner - up was much less optimistic : " wazawai " means disaster . for some japanese , 2011 brought the opposite of " kizuna " . a firm that specialised in divorce ceremonies said in july that they had tripled since the tsunami as people reassessed their lives .
ratings agency standard & poor 's downgraded hungary 's debt to junk status last week , partly due to the proposed changes to the constitution . eu and imf officials have cut short aid talks with hungary over to the law . hungary had been seeking a standby credit line of 15 - 20bn euros ( $ 19.5 bn , Â£ 12.6 bn ) in case it ran into trouble issuing new debt . but the international monetary fund and the european commission have both cast doubts over aid because of the law . on thursday , hungary abandoned part of a planned bond auction , when investors demanded a higher interest rate on the debt the country planned to issue . hungary 's central bank governor , andras simor , has said the bill amounts to a takeover of the central bank . the law has also been criticised by the european central bank , who said it raised " concern as to whether [ it ] could be used to influence the decision - making process , to the detriment of central bank independence " . international pressure the government wants to keep interest rates low to boost growth - but last week , hungary 's central bank increased rates for the the second month in a row , to 7 % from 6.5 % . consumer prices inflation in hungary is currently running at 4.25 % , well above the official 3 % target . " some amendments have been made since the original draft was presented before the christmas holiday , but concerns remain that the essence of the law has not changed , " said the bbc 's eastern europe reporter nick thorpe . " the reform of the bank would introduce deputy governors and allow the government greater potential influence over key aspects of monetary policy , such as the level of interest rates . " hungary was given a 20bn - euro standby loan by the imf in 2008 to prevent it having to default on its debts . but the newly - elected prime minister viktor orban decided not to renew the standby facility last year . standard & poor 's has cited heightened risks to the country 's ability to repay its debts due to the weakening domestic and global economic outlook .

swipes at ex-daily mirror editor piers morgan and express newspapers owner richard desmond brought wry smiles from those in attendance . but mr hislop had a serious message for inquiry chairman lord justice leveson . " statutory regulation is not required , " he said , pointing out that phone - hacking and paying police officers were already illegal . he pointed the finger at newspapers ' relationships with police and politicians , saying news international was so " deeply embedded " that the proprietor 's wife had been invited to " slumber parties " at the prime ministerial retreat chequers . it was the press complaints commission that felt the ire of alan rusbridger , editor of the guardian , whose revelations about conduct at the news of the world triggered the inquiry . rusbridger described the pcc investigation into phone - hacking as " worse than a whitewash " and said it had " undermined the principle of self - regulation " . the week had begun with the reading of a letter from former prime minister gordon brown , denying claims he had threatened to " destroy " news international during a call to rupert murdoch after the sun switched political allegiance . then daily mirror editor richard wallace admitted phone - hacking " might well have been " hidden from him when he was in charge of the paper 's showbiz desk . it could have been the source of a scoop revealing sven - goran eriksson 's affair with ulrika jonsson , mr wallace said , stressing he had no knowledge of hacking ever having taken place . similarly , sunday mirror editor tina weaver said there was " no guarantee " it had not happened at her paper . ahead of times editor james harding 's appearance , news international boss tom mockridge 's witness statement revealed one of the paper 's reporters had been disciplined for hacking into a computer . harding argued some intrusion was in the public interest , quoting the publication of adam werritty 's bank details during an investigation into the level of access he had to former defence secretary liam fox . sunday times editor john witherow called phone hacking " illegal and unethical " and said it had never happened on his paper , although he had employed private detectives . next up were the editors of
she was injured in a superpipe accident at park city in the us state of utah on 11 january . tests showed the freestyle skier had sustained " irreversible damage to her brain " , a family spokeswoman said . burke , the four - time winter x games champion , crashed on the same superpipe where snowboarder kevin pearce suffered a traumatic brain injury during a training accident in late 2009 . the best - known athlete in her sport , burke specialised in skiing the superpipe - a version of a traditional halfpipe with walls over 5m ( 16ft ) high . " sarah , in many ways , defines the sport , '' peter judge , chief executive of canada 's freestyle team , said before she died . " she 's been involved since the very , very early days as one of the first people to bring skis into the pipe . " " she 's also been very dedicated in trying to define her sport but not define herself by winning . for her , it 's been about making herself the best she can be rather than comparing herself to other people . '' a native of midland , ontario , burke won was named female action sports athlete of the year by tv network espn in 2007 . burke tore her vertebral artery as a result of the fall , which led to severe bleeding on the brain . that caused her to go into cardiac arrest on the scene , where cpr was performed . " the family expresses their heartfelt gratitude for the international outpouring of support they have received from all the people sarah touched , '' nicole wool , her spokeswoman said . burke 's organs and tissues were donated as per her wishes . the sport 's leaders defend the safety record of the superpipe and other freestyle events , pointing to requirements for mandatory helmet use , air bags on the sides of pipes during practice and better pipe - building technology . " there are inherent risks in everything , '' mr judge said prior to her death . " freestyle is a very safe sport in large part because we had to build a safe sport in order to get into the olympics . ''
in february and march , hseni staff will visit farms and speak directly to farmers and their families about their safety . the average age of farmers killed in accidents last year was 57 . the four main causes of farm deaths in northern ireland are unguarded machinery , handling livestock , falls when carrying out work at heights and incidents involving slurry tanks . the hseni is working with the ulster farmers ' union ( ufu ) and the department of agriculture and rural development ( dard ) to develop a new farm safety partnership . addressing farmers , ken logan , of the hseni , said : " hseni staff will be visiting your farm in order to discuss the dangers that you and your families face on a daily basis . " given that most northern ireland farms are worked by one or two people , this is a very personal message to you . " safety must be your number one priority as it is likely to be you or another family member who gets injured or killed . " this help initiative will provide you with an opportunity to ask questions and seek advice from my colleagues . "
the region has had an intermittent history of autonomy and occasional independence , but was finally brought under chinese control in the 18th century . economic development of the region under communist rule has been accompanied by large - scale immigration of han chinese , and uighur allegations of discrimination and marginalisation have been behind more visible anti-han and separatist sentiment since the 1990s . this has flared into violence on occasion . country profiles compiled by bbc monitoring making sense of unrest views from china xinjiang , about the size of iran , is divided into the dzungarian basin in the north and the tarim basin in the south by a mountain range . the economy of this once agricultural region has developed fast since 1949 , and oil and petrochemicals now account for about 60 per cent of its gdp . it is also an important trade and pipeline route into central asia and beyond . the region was contested by various turkic groups , mongols and the chinese until the 18th century , when the chinese qing dynasty brought the whole area under its control . russia 's conquest of the neighbouring central asian states of kokand and bukhara led to a renewed struggle for control over the area , with the kokand general yaqub bek establishing a de facto independent state in kashgar in 1865 . china gradually regained control of the region and formally set up xinjiang province in 1884 . russian influence remained strong , especially during the rule of various warlords after the fall of the qing dynasty in 1912 . the soviet union supported an uighur - led separatist east turkestan republic in the north of the region in 1944 - 1949 , but helped to extinguish it when the communists took over in china proper . communist china established the autonomous region in 1955 , and began to encourage han chinese to settle there in new industrial towns and farming villages run by the quasi-military xinjiang production and development corps . china also set up its nuclear testing facility at lop nur in the tarim basin , conducting the first test there in 1964 . in the 2000 census han chinese made up 40 per cent of the population of xinjiang , excluding large numbers of troops stationed in the region and unknown numbers of unregistered migrants , and uighurs accounted

" if he 's popped a rib cartilage or torn some of those muscles around that area , it 's pretty serious , " said mcdermott . " i do n't want to write him off . but he sore and not looking great , " he added . " we 'll give him until the 11th hour . given that he 's started off this year pretty well for us and his head is in the right place , i 'll give him as long as we can . " the rhinos have an obvious replacement in ben jones - bishop , a member of their grand final - winning team in october , who was also in the england squad for the four nations series . " we 've got a couple of options there , " mcdermott added . " ben jones - bishop is probably the notable one . " if it 's him , i 'm sure he 'll be doing everything possible to keep hold of his shirt .

" we 'll enjoy playing at headingley , " he said . " we 're in familiar surroundings and obviously the majority of the fans will be from leeds . " i do n't think it will give us too much of an advantage . for a one - off game , these aussie fellas will come and give it their best shot .

stevenage had an exciting tie with tottenham hotspur , and everyone assumed spurs would win . but the game finished 0 - 0 , which means there 'll now be a replay between the two sides at white hart lane . on saturday birmingham held on to a 1 - 1 draw with chelsea at stamford bridge , meaning they too will have a replay . leicester city finished norwich city 's hopes of cup glory with a 2 - 1 victory , while stoke did the same to blackpool 2 - 0 . in a north - south battle , bolton beat millwall 2 - 0 . arsenal 's 2 - 0 defeat to sunderland leaves the team with hardly any chance of lifting a trophy for the seventh season in a row . manager arsene wenger says it 's the lowest point of his career at arsenal so far .
a shop worker caught the female arachnid in a plastic jar before calling the scottish spca . the spider , with a 10 cm leg span , was taken to the edinburgh butterfly and insect world where it later died . shop worker , petra merriman , 45 , caught the spider . she said her male colleagues had been " in panic " after discovering the spider . she said : " all the boys were running round like headless chickens . " one of the chaps who was putting a box of bananas in the display took a lid off a box and saw it was curled around a banana . " we got a phone call in the back office saying come and deal with this spider . " the guys all said ' i 'm not going . ' i said i would . i 'm not arachnophobic at all . " she added : " i brought a pot with a secure lid down with me , and i just popped it in . " i did n't have to touch it , i just put the pot underneath it . " nothing like this has ever happened here before . " kevin thom , of edinburgh butterfly and insect world , said : " it is n't deadly but its venom contains high levels of serotonin . " if bitten you would experience pain , swelling , muscle spasms and flu - like symptoms which could be very unpleasant , depending on the amount of venom that was injected . " these spiders can survive transport from abroad by shutting down and becoming very cold . " they awaken when they warm up , which is often under bright shop lights . " this female has possibly suffered shock in transit or it may simply have been her time to die . "
a preliminary report into the project , to be released on thursday , found that only half of inmates did this . boris johnson insisted it had made progress . he said it looked like there had been a " substantial reduction in reoffending " . but the report found that only half of inmates went into education , training or employment after release , and just one in six stayed in such an occupation for six months . project daedalus cost nearly Â£ 2.5 m , which mainly came from a european fund . but when that money ends , so will the programme . prisons minister crispin blunt revealed the scheme will not continue after may and said the mayor now wants to set up a new initiative . that will be focused on london as a whole and also targeted at younger boys on remand , as well as some convicted of crimes . tottenham mp david lammy , who has visited the feltham unit and supported the project , is angry it has not delivered what was hoped . he said : " we 're being told that the money has dried up , it 's been cancelled and it has n't been evaluated . that 's unacceptable . " a few years ago this was the flagship - you ca n't just discard it quietly , you 've got to explain why you 've decided to destroy it . " central to the project were resettlement brokers , charity workers who helped inmates adjust to the outside . many prisoners said they made a " positive contribution " but there have been too few spread too thinly across london . and critics said the payment - by - results model meant not enough money was paid upfront to improve this . roger graef , a criminologist , said : " if we do n't spend money early on in trying to prevent crime or to avoid people going back to crime , they will go back to crime . " the money needs to be there right from the beginning and all the way through if they 're going to get the kind of support that will change their lives . " mayor of london boris johnson said : " it 's looking like there has been a substantial reduction in reoffending . " even
it ousted local officials three months ago and won the right to elections as part of a deal to end unrest there . respected elder lin zuluan was voted in as village chief , with yang semao his deputy . after his landslide victory , with 6,205 votes on an 80 % turnout , mr lin said : " with this kind of recognition from the villagers , i 'll work doubly hard for them . " some 6,800 residents had turned up at a local school to cast their ballots . five other seats on the village committee will be filled in a run - off vote on sunday . activists from other parts of the country had travelled to wukan to observe the polls and to try to highlight their own grievances . " wukan is an example for us , " hua youjuan , a village chief from huangshan in eastern china where residents have also protested against corruption , told reuters . " what wukan has achieved through its solidarity is something we can also learn from , " he added . protests had been simmering in wukan since september . villagers said officials had sold off their land to developers and failed to compensate them properly . the unrest escalated after the death of a village negotiator in police custody in december . police say he died of a " sudden illness " , but his family say he was beaten to death . the granting of elections was seen as a surprising concession from the guangdong authorities , led by ambitious communist party head wang yang .
allen hit early century breaks of 104 and 127 before finishing off the first session with a run of 123 to lead 8 - 1 . the world number 10 sealed victory by winning both frames after the restart . allen picked up a cheque for Â£ 75,000 for his first ranking tournament triumph . he moved into a 5 - 0 lead helped by breaks 104 , 50 , 127 and 53 before lee opened his account with a run of 67 in frame six . lee was further demoralised when allen came back from requiring a snooker to win the eighth frame and the northern irishman hit his third century of the match in the final frame of the first session .

teams from black and ethnic minority communities have told radio wales ' eye on wales programme of the comments , abuse and hostility they say they encounter at some matches , from players , spectators and even match officials . there have been a number of racial incidents at football matches in wales over the past year , including last april when a linesman at a welsh league game between cwmbran town fc and grange harlequins fc , from cardiff , was disciplined by the football association of wales for a comment made to a player . he was fined Â£ 750 and banned from the cwmbran town ground for five months . and last august , pontypridd team graig fc were disciplined by the south wales football association for misconduct after supporters of the side were racially abusive towards visiting stm sports fc , from llanrumney , cardiff . mohamed dualeh , secretary and manager of tiger bay fc , made up of predominantly somali players from south cardiff , told the programme of an incident in a game in which his team played . " the team that we were playing , one of our players was involved in a rough challenge . the referee decided that was worth a red card , " he said . " the referee pulled his red card and issued to the wrong player . the team captain approached the referee and said ' ref , you are sending off the wrong player . ' " he looked at the player and said ' you all look like the same . ' " the wrong player walked off the pitch and served a three - match ban when he 's not the one who was involved . " sunil patel , campaigns manager for show racism the red card in wales , who provide anti-racism education and awareness training , said the organisation would be launching a campaign later this year to encourage players to report incidents of racism , in the hope of obtaining a clearer picture of the extent of the problem . " we 've had reports for about five years , since we were established , " said mr patel . " things that players and clubs tell us is about the racism that 's coming from the fans , specifically in areas that are not that diverse
the company tried to bring high - speed net services to rural areas by using local champions and private finance . rival net firms have stepped in to keep customers connected in some areas , but others have effectively been cut off . next genus had been using a mixture of fibre cables and wireless to take very high speed broadband ( 10 - 60 megabits per second ) to some parts of the uk that would struggle to get it any other way . it provided marketing materials and support to locals to help them generate interest in getting the high - speed service and , once enough people had committed , began putting infrastructure in place to serve them . the service had proved popular in parts of cumbria , lincolnshire and east yorkshire , where significant numbers of customers had signed up . many were cut off this week when the company revealed that there was " no realistic prospect " of it finding enough money to pay its creditors . in hull and east yorkshire , rival quickline stepped in to keep net connections running - as did isp kcom in hull . in cumbria , next genus 's service was briefly stopped then restarted as talks began with a potential investor . it said it was working to find purchasers for other parts of its network . next genus has not answered any requests for comment . its blog said that : " customers will be receiving an email in the near future giving more information .

" the bbc visited three supermarkets in jersey , the co-op in charing cross , waitrose at rue des pres and marks & spencer in king street ; and three in petersfield in hampshire : tesco , waitrose and marks & spencer . he said he found out that doing business in jersey was not cheap either . the channel islands co-op is one of the supermarkets that imports tons of food and other items from the uk every week which costs the business Â£ 60,000 a month . colin mcleod , the co-op 's chief executive , said : " we 've got high land costs , we 've got high build costs , we 've got high labour costs . but we 're doing the best we can in that environment for our members . " a spokesman for waitrose in jersey said : " we continually monitor our prices to ensure we remain as competitive as possible , and because of this shoppers may find that many of our products now cost less than when we first opened our shops in the island . " we need to reflect the additional costs of getting products to the channel islands in our prices but we pass on the savings of uk vat to our shoppers in jersey and have hundreds of relevant and meaningful promotions across our branches each week . " tony o'neill , the chief executive of sandpiper ci , said over half their products in marks & spencer are sold on promotion . the citizens advice bureau and the community savings bank told the bbc they were seeing more clients . brian curtis , executive chairman of the community savings bank , said it was not just those who find themselves unemployed . he said : " i know some people
it helped almost 370,000 people with money worries last year , and according to the charity 25 % of them said their problems were caused by unemployment or redundancy . only 10 % of the charity 's clients say they are in debt because they 've not managed their finances properly . so we asked one of their counsellors , jonathan chesterman , to give some free advice to people at a shopping centre in reading . alex taylor left university last year with a law degree , but he still ca n't find a job , and now he 's feeling the pinch . he says : " on top of the 18 grand 's worth of student debt , i 've also accumulated quite a lot of overdraft debt . my bank is pushing me to pay it back , despite the fact that i 'm on jobseeker 's allowance . " and the jobseeker 's i 'm on at the moment is not enough to pay back an overdraft . so i 'm just wondering what i can do . anything i can do to alleviate the problem would be great . " mr chesterman 's first tip is to move bank account , so any income is n't paid into the same account as his overdraft . he adds : " then i 'd keep your current bank informed of your situation , and offer them a small token payment , maybe Â£ 1 or Â£ 2 a month . you can show you 're serious about paying your debt back , but you ca n't actually pay it back at the moment . " tom hill , 20 , is doing the job he loves . or more accurately , he 's doing four or five jobs he loves . he 's a football coach , but ca n't find one full - time role that pays enough . he is scraping by financially , but knows he could do better . he admits : " when i go out in town , i spend too much on drinks and things like that . i spend on games and the like , and then look at my bank balance and it 's all bad . so too many luxuries , that 's probably it .

by fostering economic cooperation and helping countries with balance of payments problems the founders hoped to avoid a repeat of the 1930s great depression . the imf aims to preserve economic stability and to tackle - or ideally prevent - financial crises . over time , its focus has switched to the developing world . the world bank 's predecessor - the international bank for reconstruction and development - was set up to drive post-war recovery . now , it is the world 's leading development organisation , working for growth and poverty reduction . owned by the governments of its 187 member states , the bank channels loans and grants and advises low and middle - income countries . the imf is funded by a charge - known as a " quota " - paid by member nations . the quota is based on a country 's wealth and it determines voting power within the organisation ; those making higher contributions have greater voting rights . the imf acts as a lender of last resort , disbursing its foreign exchange reserves for short periods to any member in difficulties . since they were conceived , the imf has been run by a european and the world bank by a us national . the imf and the bank have served as a rallying point for disparate causes - from environmentalists to anarchists - and meetings have occasionally been accompanied by violent street protests . protesters and critics cite the exploitation of the poor and the environment and argue that freer trade threatens the livelihoods of millions of people . the imf has admitted that forcing developing countries to open their markets to foreign investors can increase the risk of financial crises . its former managing director horst koehler said in 2002 that the benefits of globalisation had not been equally shared . but he added that " the objective should not be less globalisation but more and better globalisation .

the pair are the fourth party to launch a bid . west ham united confirmed they were one of the candidates last friday , which was the deadline day for applications . essex said in a statement : " we can confirm that the university of east london and essex county cricket club have jointly put in a bid to the olympic park legacy company ( oplc ) to utilise space in the olympic stadium . " we can not provide any further detail at this stage , as we are bound by a legal confidentiality agreement . " we [ ... ] see this as a fantastic opportunity [ and ] are committed to supporting the achievement of the best possible outcomes from the legacy operation of the olympic stadium . " west ham were initially awarded the stadium in a partnership with newham council in october last year , but the deal fell through following complaints from rival clubs tottenham hotspur and leyton orient . the oplc subsequently decided the venue would remain in public ownership , retaining the athletics facilities , and opened a fresh bidding process to find a tenant , which ended last week . it is not known at this stage whether the proposal from essex and uel , who are based in stratford , combines a cricket pitch with the athletics track . the melbourne cricket ground was temporarily adapted to accommodate track and field sports for the 2006 commonwealth games . county championship division two side essex currently play in chelmsford , their home for 87 years , and announced profits of over Â£ 300,000 for 2011 . however , that figure included " exceptional income " from the england and wales cricket board to cover the cost of previous ground improvements .
" this panel can find nothing good as far as suitability factors go , " said a member of the bench , john peck . manson , convicted in 1971 and serving life for seven murders , has not appeared before the board since 1997 . his previous hearing was in 2007 . debra tate , the sister of a manson victim , said earlier she would attend to argue against his release . " i 've tried to take this thing that i do , that has become my lot in life , and make it have purpose , " ms tate , whose sister was actress sharon tate , told the associated press news agency . " i 've been doing it for sharon and the other victims of him for the last 40 years . " the wife of film director roman polanski , sharon tate was eight - and - a-half months pregnant when she was murdered by the manson gang . the cult leader and his followers , known as the manson family , stabbed and shot seven people in los angeles over two nights in 1969 in an attempt to start a race war . manson and three women accomplices were sentenced to death in 1969 , but that was commuted in 1972 when california temporarily outlawed the death penalty . since his last parole hearing , manson has been caught in possession of a weapon , twice with contraband mobile phones , and has threatened an official , according to the california department of corrections . prison officials found he had been talking with people in california , new jersey , florida , british columbia , arkansas , massachusetts and indiana . debra tate said earlier she doubted manson would ever be freed but hopes that she can confront any perception of him as a cult figure . she said : " it 's important to me that i try to diminish and tarnish their status as urban legends . it 's wrong , it 's just plain wrong . "
life expectancy is going up all round , but the rates for men are increasing faster . plummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change . prof mayhew , a professor of statistics at cass business school , analysed life expectancy data in england and wales . he was working out how long 30 - year - olds could expect to live . his findings show men languishing far behind for decades , but now starting to get closer to women . if current trends continue , prof mayhew predicts , both sexes could , on average , be living to the age of 87 in 2030 . he said : " what 's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so , male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy . " the reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle . " one of the main reasons , i think , is the trend in the prevalence of smoking . smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80 % of males smoked . " this was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy , so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years . " other factors are thought to be safer , more office - based , jobs . millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining . healthcare has meant more men live longer as well . people with heart disease , which is more common in men , can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago . by contrast , women started smoking later than men . , but are falling fast in men . a boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies , as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30 . boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents . it
" this is an exciting moment for the tate , " said its director nicholas serota . " the tanks will be the first spaces dedicated permanently to live art installation and performance in any museum building anywhere in the world . " the bbc 's home of 2012 : latest olympic news , sport , culture , torch relay , video and audio tate bosses say the work in the tanks will reflect a greater public appetite to engage with art and artists . the tanks are the first phase of a Â£ 215 million extension project that will increase tate modern 's size by 60 % by adding 21,000 square metres of new space . serota said that 75 % of funding - more than Â£ 162 million - had been had been raised and he hoped building work would be complete before december 2016 . the project has received Â£ 50 million of government money , Â£ 7 million from the greater london authority and the remainder from private donors who " wish to remain anonymous " . the south and east tanks originally contained oil that fuelled the power station - now occupied by tate modern - and have been unused since it was decommissioned in 1981 . each one is some 30 metres across and seven metres high . the giant subterranean spaces will now host live art and film programmes , which have previously been presented in diverse spaces around tate modern . " we will see many more works which involve the spectator , " said tate modern director chris dircon . " there is an incredible appetite for participation . " the opening programme in the east tank includes a major new commission by south korean artist sung hwan kimn " which sees him interweave korean culture , folklore and history , his own personal experiences and fantasy " . the south tank will host a rolling series of projects including one by belgian choreographer anne teresa de keersmaeker , who will rework and perform a version of her early work , 1982 's fase : four movements to the music of steve reich . london - born artist eddie peake , whose previous work includes a choreographed a football game for nude players , will create a new commission that " explores sexuality and voyeurism " . there will also be
in hebron , the west bank 's biggest city , there are now about 50 women among the 900 police officers deployed locally . their presence challenges stereotypes but it is traditional values that make it necessary . " the idea came about because hebron is a conservative city and people did n't accept policemen entering and searching a house where women were present , " says hebron police chief , brig ramdan awwad . he says some palestinian criminals have been taking advantage of strict religious and social codes to literally hide behind their wives ' skirts . drug - dealers have used women as couriers , hiding contraband beneath their clothes in the certain knowledge that no palestinian policeman would dare to search them . raids on suspects ' homes have been fruitless because drugs and other illegal items were secreted with the women of the house . the new women 's police unit has ended this . " the plan is not to go inside any house without having a police woman with the team , " says brigadier awwad . women officers are given special riot training and proudly take part in raids alongside their male colleagues . insherah abu allam recalls one occasion when a team of male officers were denied access to search a house by its female residents . she and her fellow women officers were also turned back so they scaled the walls and climbed onto the roof to gain entry . " the male officers and all the neighbours could n't believe what they were seeing . they stood there watching in awe , " says insherah . " we do not see women in these types of roles in the west bank . " the women also play an important role in community liaison , particularly with young palestinians . wajeeha tahboub is in charge of the juveniles ' unit in hebron . " my unit was established a year ago . i specialise in dealing with people under the age of 18 , " she says . " i work at increasing trust between the community and the police . i visit schools and talk to children about the police force . " such a role is important in terms of changing perceptions of the police . crimes among palestinians are still often still settled between families . the
for mr netanyahu , the number one issue has long been israel 's security , and he has taken a tough line towards the palestinians , seeing land - for - peace as too dangerous to accept . his third term shifted from renewed peace talks , which collapsed in acrimony , to war with militants in gaza just three months later . benjamin " bibi " netanyahu was born in tel aviv in 1949 . in 1963 his family moved to the us when his father benzion , the historian and zionist activist , was offered an academic post . at the age of 18 , benjamin netanyahu returned to israel , where he spent five distinguished years in the army , serving as a captain in an elite commando unit , the sayeret matkal . he took part in a raid on beirut 's airport in 1968 and fought in the 1973 middle east war . after his military service ended , mr netanyahu went back to the us , where he earned bachelor 's and master 's degrees at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) . in 1976 , mr netanyahu 's brother , jonathan , was killed leading a raid to rescue hostages from a hijacked airliner in entebbe , uganda . his death had a profound impact on the netanyahu family , and his name became legendary in israel . mr netanyahu set up an anti-terrorism institute in his brother 's memory , and caught the attention of the then israeli ambassador to the us and future foreign minister , moshe arens . in 1982 , mr arens made benjamin netanyahu his deputy chief of mission in washington . overnight , mr netanyahu 's public life was launched . an articulate english speaker with a distinctive american accent , he became a familiar face on us television and an effective advocate of the israeli cause . mr netanyahu was then appointed israel 's permanent representative at the un in new york in 1984 . only in 1988 , when he returned to israel , did he become involved in domestic politics , winning a seat in the knesset ( parliament ) and becoming deputy foreign minister . politically , benjamin netanyahu positioned himself to the right of previous leaders of likud . after likud lost the 1992 general election , he became party
the firm has attracted plenty of criticism , suggesting it is little better than a digital loan - shark , exploiting the skint and vulnerable . in january the firm was at the centre of controversy about adverts encouraging students with jobs to take out loans to pay for things like trips abroad . and in march fans of some football clubs called for the company 's adverts to be removed from their clubs ' websites . this week it attracted more attention by launching a loan service aimed at businesses which are short of cash . errol damelin , wonga 's founder , is remarkably unperturbed by the critics . at a briefing for journalists this week , he was happy and confident about the prospects for his business , and also the legitimacy of short - term money lending . according to him , wonga is the equivalent of itunes for the financial world . " wonga is a platform for the future of financial services , the digital revolution has not yet begun in financial services , " he said . likening his company to firms like google , amazon , paypal and netflix , he argued that using technology and data about his customers would be the key to success . " wonga is on a multi-year and multi-decade journey to build the future of financial services , using data and technology to make objective and unprejudiced decisions , " said mr damelin . people borrow money from wonga by applying on its website . this offers a swift decision and then transfers the money into a bank account within 15 minutes . the firm employs more than 100 staff just to develop its technology and make sure the site works properly . its key feature is that it combines information about potential customers in a massive in - house credit scoring operation . errol damelin said his computers use artificial - intelligence software to collect and digest up to 8,000 different pieces of information about applicants to decide if they should be offered loans . " we have built the world 's first , completely straight - through processing system for credit , so when somebody comes to wonga as an individual , or as a business - owner , and applies for a cash advance , the whole process is completely automated , "
they account for 12 % of syria 's population , or just under 3 million people , and yet have been in tight control of a sunni - majority country , for more than 40 years . after a coup in 1970 , led by president bashar al - assad 's father hafez , alawites consolidated power over syria 's main institutions and security apparatus . hafez 's identity as an alawite helped him gain the loyalty of other minority groups in syria , to whom he promised rights and protection . alawites are seen by other muslims in the middle east as very liberal or even secular . in syria women are not encouraged to wear hejab and many choose not to fast or pray . some muslims consider the alawites a heretic sect . nusairism , as alawism was originally called , emerged in the 9th and 10th centuries in syria . the word alawite , or alawi means " follower of ali " , who was a cousin and son - in - law of the prophet muhammad . shia muslims also venerate imam ali and like the alawis believe he was the true heir to the prophet and should have succeeded him . the perception that alawis regard ali as a deity or god in human form is what provokes disdain from some orthodox sunni muslims . bbc radio 4 's analysis profiles syria 's alawis , the sect to which president assad belongs . listen via the bbc iplayer download the analysis podcast explore the best of analysis they regard the alawite notion of ali as heretical and a challenge to the fundamental belief that there is only one indisputable manifestation of god . but some scholars argue this is a misinterpretation and alawis actually believe ali to be an essence or form , rather than a human being , through which followers can try to " grasp god " . in addition to the main tenets of islam , alawis observe two others , " jihad " or struggle and " waliya " , the devotion to imam ali and his family . traditionally , many alawi practices are carried out in secret , in line with the shia custom of taqiyya , which is the practice of hiding one 's beliefs in order to avoid persecution . syria 's alawis are concentrated mainly
donald , 34 , becomes only the third player to retain the title and clinched his sixth tournament win in 15 months . rose could not quite match his playing partner and took 70 to end 11 under as 1999 open champion lawrie shot 66 . clubhouse scores in full " to defend and get back to number one is very sweet indeed , " said donald , who joins sir nick faldo ( 1980 - 81 ) and colin montgomerie ( 1998-1999-2000 ) as the only players to make a successful defence of the european tour 's flagship event . donald needed only a top - eight finish to take top spot after mcilroy missed the cut at wentworth , and he took a two - shot lead over rose into the final round . the lead was up to three strokes when rose bogeyed the short second , though he grabbed one back at the third and then drained another birdie on the long fourth to level on 10 under as donald suffered a temporary blip . " donald said he would be nervous heading into his final round and that apprehension would have been heightened when his two stroke lead had disappeared after four holes . so the englishman deserves great credit for the way that he responded to successfully defend his title , ultimately at a canter . this is a win that should embolden donald as he seeks his elusive first major title . he will be justifiably among the favourites at next month 's us open and after triumphing at a tough wentworth has every reason to believe he is capable of a similar result at olympic club . " he opted to lay - up short of the green in two but then three - putted following an uncharacteristically poor chip for his only bogey of the round . but that was as close as rose got as the imperturbable donald made back - to - back birdies on the sixth and seventh and stretched clear with a 25ft putt for a birdie at the 10th and another birdie at the 12th . world number 10 rose struggled to make any impression and carded seven pars in a row before his own birdie on 12 . donald added a further birdie from five feet on 16 and went five clear as rose dropped
negotiations have so far failed to produce a permanent peace agreement , and the dispute remains one of post-soviet europe 's " frozen conflicts . " the conflict has roots dating back well over a century into competition between christian armenian and muslim turkic and persian influences . populated for centuries by christian armenian and turkic azeris , karabakh became part of the russian empire in the 19th century . profile compiled by bbc monitoring the two groups lived in relative peace , although acts of brutality on both sides in the early 20th century live on in the popular memory . after the end of world war i and the bolshevik revolution in russia , the new soviet rulers , as part of their divide - and - rule policy in the region , established the nagorno - karabakh autonomous region , with an ethnic armenian majority , within the soviet socialist republic of azerbaijan in the early 1920s . as soviet control loosened towards the end of the 1980s , smouldering armenian - azeri frictions exploded into violence when the region 's parliament voted to join armenia . during the fighting , in which between 20,000 and 30,000 people are estimated to have lost their lives , the ethnic armenians gained control of the region . they also pushed on to occupy azerbaijani territory outside karabakh , creating a buffer zone linking karabakh and armenia . with the break - up of the soviet union , in late 1991 , karabakh declared itself an independent republic , further escalating the conflict into a full - scale war . that de facto status has not been recognised elsewhere . while armenia itself has never officially recognised the region 's independence , it has become its main financial and military backer . a russian - brokered ceasefire was signed in 1994 , leaving karabakh as well as swathes of azeri territory around the enclave in armenian hands . during the fighting , in which more than one million fled their homes , the ethnic azeri population - about 25 % of the total before the war - fled karabakh and armenia while ethnic armenians fled the rest of azerbaijan . neither population group has been able to return home since the end of the war . karabakh is the russian rendering of an azeri word meaning ' black garden '
the fine , yet unrelenting , rain did not show mercy either to the soaked singers who gamely sang the national anthem in the closing stages . these events were the dying embers of a day that had seen fun , food , celebrations , dressing up and several renditions of the national anthem , as well as a protest against the monarchy - all stubbornly carried out despite the rain . at the start of the day , some revellers heading to the capital had their plans disrupted by overcrowding on the train network , with reports of passengers left behind on platforms because carriages were full . others stayed at home to celebrate , with almost 9,500 roads shut across england and wales for parties . those in the capital threw themselves into the celebrations , none more so than those who attended the big jubilee lunch in piccadilly , made up of a long line of tables in this usually traffic - choked street . the main events to mark the queen 's diamond jubilee include : monday tuesday guide to the weekend of events wandering down piccadilly , resplendent in their tiaras and red , white and blue outfits , were three friends - jodie merrylees , 27 , from cheltenham , gloucestershire , charlotte symonds , 30 , from brighouse , west yorkshire , and jodie cosgrove , 27 , from leeds . ms symonds said : " i really like the royal family and the tradition it represents . i was at the royal wedding too and that was brilliant . we wanted to dress up for the jubilee and get involved with the atmosphere to feel part of the celebrations . " it became an even more grand event when the duke and duchess of cornwall arrived , walking down the line of tables and even stopping to sit down on a potentially soggy seat to chat to some of those munching their food . street parties were definitely popular on the day , particularly in bristol , which had more applications for road closures than in other city outside london . revellers there gathered in a red , white and blue - bedecked millennium square , which boasted its own " make your own corgi " attraction . inspired by the thames pageant , andrew southerden , a landlord in kibworth ,
trouble flared after the murder of a buddhist woman last month , followed by an attack on a bus carrying muslims . on sunday , former colonial power the uk urged authorities and community leaders to begin talks to end the violence . foreign office minister jeremy browne said he was " deeply concerned " by the situation and that the uk and other countries would continue to watch developments closely . a state of emergency essentially allows the military to take over administrative control of the region . state television said the order , imposed late sunday night , was in response to increasing " unrest and terrorist attacks " and " intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately " . according to a reuters report , the violence over the weekend began on friday in the rakhine state town of maungdaw , spreading to the capital sittwe and neighbouring villages . rival buddhist and muslim groups were witnessed setting houses on fire , reports said . " we have now ordered troops to protect the airport and the rakhine villages under attack in sittwe , " zaw htay , director of the president 's office was quoted as saying by reuters . in a televised speech , president thein sein said the violence could put the country 's moves towards democracy in danger . " if we put racial and religious issues at the forefront , if we put the never - ending hatred , desire for revenge and anarchic actions at the forefront , and if we continue to retaliate and terrorise and kill each other , there 's a danger that [ the troubles ] could multiply and move beyond rakhine , " he said . " if this happens , the general public should be aware that the country 's stability and peace , democratisation process and development , which are only in transition right now , could be severely affected and much would be lost . " a nominally civilian government was elected in 2010 and , in april this year , opposition politicians led by aung san suu kyi entered burma 's parliament following historic by - elections . however , the government is still dominated by the military and concerns over political repression and human rights abuses continue . the clashes began on 4 june when a mob attacked
and Â£ 22m will go on training facilities and increasing the stadium capacity . the announcement comes just days after the championship club said they were going ahead with plans to rebrand the club , including changing the kit from blue to red and introducing a new badge incorporating a welsh dragon . the colour change , which has divided opinion among fans , is part of the investment pledge , with the owners insisting the use of a dragon will expand the club 's appeal in " international markets " and " will give this club a new focus and dynamism " . tan insisted he appreciated the change was " extremely emotional and for some quarters remains difficult to understand " . but he said : " i would like to emphasise that i hold no desire to trample on club history or heritage and would be saddened if supporters thought that this was my intention . " and he added : " there is no reason why any existing supporter needs to feel disenfranchised . this is and always will remain your club . " cardiff city have missed out on promotion to the premier league through the play - offs in the last two seasons . the owners hope the significant cash for squad strengthening will help their bid for top - flight status and end what they say is an operating loss of Â£ 1m a month . in the statement , tan confirmed : " cardiff city is expecting a cash injection in the amount of Â£ 35m to meet its financial obligations for the period from now until may 2013 , including a substantial amount for squad strengthening within budgets . " of this amount , Â£ 10m has been earmarked to settle the longstanding langston debt , which if accepted by langston will go a long way to cleaning up the balance sheet of the club . " this further Â£ 35 million cash injection coupled with my earlier investment of Â£ 40.8 million will add up to a very sizeable Â£ 75.8 million invested in the club . " in addition to this , we have budgeted Â£ 10 million for the new premier league standard training facilities and Â£ 12 million to increase the stadium capacity by an additional 8,000 seats to 35,000 seats .

" if the commission tells me i was n't supposed to list the bibliography at the end but insert it as footnotes , of course i will give up my doctor 's title immediately . i am not mad about titles , i do n't care about this one .

yet the economic and financial solutions to the eurozone crisis are actually surprisingly straightforward . how so ? easy . just ask how the exact same problems have been solved by the members of that other large ( and much better functioning ) single currency area - the united states of america . europe 's real problem is that almost all of the solutions are far from politically palatable . the eurozone 's root problem is that the southern european economies have become fundamentally uncompetitive - their wages rose too quickly during the boom years , which led them to import a lot more than they exported , and borrow the difference . the southern economies ' excessive debts , persistent uncompetitiveness and resulting need to continue borrowing - along with germany 's reluctance to give them the money - is what has driven the financial panic that has made it much harder for southern european governments and banks to borrow from markets . what 's more , the seizing up of european financial markets - not to mention the collective determination of europe 's governments to cut spending , and the european central bank 's focus on price stability - is threatening to push the entire continent into a long and deep recession , something that would merely compound the debt problems . so , if the eurozone were to look at the us model for inspiration in its hour of need , what sorts of changes - economic , financial and , ultimately , political - might need to be considered ? europe 's most immediate task is to restore confidence in its banks . all the bad loans made by eurozone banks ( loans to mortgage borrowers , property speculators and even governments that may not be fully repaid ) may need to be cleaned up ( by injecting money into the banks ) , with the potential losses borne by the eurozone as a whole - because many national governments probably can not afford it . in the case of spain 's banks , the current bailout deal leaves spain 's government sitting on all the losses . deposits at all eurozone banks may need to be guaranteed in euros by the eurozone as a whole , in order to stop panicky investors from moving their money from banks in southern european countries at risk of

and understanding these factors could offer up new treatments . the research in the lancet compared the dna of 7,400 uk osteoarthritis patients with that of 11,000 healthy volunteers . this allowed scientists to find the most promising " culprit " regions of the genetic code to study in more detail . they repeated their work in another group of 7,500 people with osteoarthritis and about 43,000 individuals without the condition from iceland , estonia , the netherlands , and the uk . the results confirmed the three previously reported gene variants and found a further eight linked to osteoarthritis . further work is now needed to pinpoint the actual dna changes within the genetic regions to establish exactly how these changes lead to osteoarthritis . the one with the strongest effect was situated in the region of the gnl3 gene which produces a protein with an important role in cell maintenance . three others were in dna regions involved in the regulation of cartilage , bone development and body weight . one of the lead scientists , john loughlin , who is professor of musculoskeletal research at newcastle university , said : " we know that osteoarthritis runs in families and that this is due to the genes that people pass on , rather than their shared environment . " in this study we were able to say with a high degree of confidence which genetic regions are the major risk factors for developing osteoarthritis : the first time that this has been possible for this common yet complex disease . it 's an important first step . " prof alan silman , medical director of arthritis research uk , the charity that funded the work , said : " until we understand the cause of this complex disease , we can not hope to find a cure . this is a major breakthrough in our understanding of osteoarthritis , which we hope will help us to unlock the genetic basis of the disease .

green said that he was " deeply disappointed " by the ' no ' vote . he added : " if our application were to be accepted , rangers will play in whichever division the sfl sees fit and we will move forward from there . " rangers went into administration in february owing up to Â£ 134m to unsecured creditors . the club will eventually be liquidated and its registrations with the scottish fa and spl were terminated . we regret that our club and our supporters were given false hope the majority of spl clubs had indicated they were against the newco application prior to the vote but green complained that he had been given " false hope " of success . " we are deeply disappointed that our application to rejoin the spl has been rejected overwhelmingly by the member clubs , " explained green . " this time last week , all of us at rangers were resigned to the fact that we would not be admitted , due mainly to the public declarations of clubs indicating they would not support our application . " at the weekend , we were approached by representatives from the spl suggesting our application still stood a chance of success and we should discuss this further with clubs . this we did in good faith but with the knowledge of the hurdles that lay ahead of us . media playback is not supported on this device " we had asked the spl whether it would be more appropriate for us to withdraw our application but were advised against this . " we made a presentation to the spl clubs this morning , detailing our proposals in support of our application and this included what we believed to be penalties and sanctions that would have dealt fairly with the difficulties caused by events at rangers prior to our acquisition of the club on 14 june . " sadly , this was rejected by the other clubs and we regret that our club and our supporters were given false hope by this initiative . " we will now proceed as we had planned from late june to apply for membership of the sfl . " it is entirely a matter for them whether our application will be accepted or rejected and we will make no representation to any member club prior to

it was the 32 - year - old triple olympic champion 's first stage win on the tour . " it is a fantastic day for british cycling . i never thought i would see a stage like this . a one - two on the stage podium . bradley wiggins just kept going and he is great at time - trialling . he will have had all the information given to him and he has had a perfect session . cadel evans had a poor start and tried to chip away at the deficit but never looked like recovering it . " defending champion cadel evans remains second overall but is now one minute and 53 seconds behind wiggins . the australian had begun the day only 10 seconds adrift but ended up fighting to stay ahead of froome in the general classification , after the team sky rider 's impressive performance saw him move up to third , a further 14 seconds back . tuesday is the first rest day , with the tour heading for the mountains on wednesday . wiggins , who assumed the overall lead on saturday , said : " time - trialling is what i do best . i know exactly the routine what i need to do . i felt great from the first pedal stroke and i knew i was in for a good one . " this is what we have trained for . the graft during the winter , missing the kids ' birthdays having been at training camps - this is what it is for . to get the stage win is fantastic . " froome , the winner of stage seven , added : " there is no tactics in something like today . this is by far the hardest event in cycling . you just have to go as fast as you can and turn yourself inside out to get the best time . " it is good to know you are on track for a good time , but you have to be careful you do not overcook it so it is a fine line to gauge that effort . bradley wiggins becomes the 11th briton to win a tour de france stage " i am really happy with today and i went hard at it . that is all i can do . i
