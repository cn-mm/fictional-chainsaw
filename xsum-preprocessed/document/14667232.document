But suspicious neighbours confronted the couple and reported them to police .
The two women are now back with their families , forcibly separated and under surveillance by the Islamic police .
The local Sharia police chief told them Islam said they must be beheaded and burned for what they had done .
But Aceh , the only province in Indonesia that is allowed to implement Sharia law , has yet to adopt any provisions dealing with gay and lesbian people .
The provincial parliament passed Islamic laws authorising the stoning to death of adulterers and the caning of homosexuals in 2009 , but the governor has refused to sign it .
Homosexuality is frowned upon but legal in Indonesia .
Activists have blamed Aceh 's Sharia laws for encouraging vigilantism and intolerance , and say they violate the Indonesian constitution .
