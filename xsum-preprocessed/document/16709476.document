In February and March , HSENI staff will visit farms and speak directly to farmers and their families about their safety .
The average age of farmers killed in accidents last year was 57 .
The four main causes of farm deaths in Northern Ireland are unguarded machinery , handling livestock , falls when carrying out work at heights and incidents involving slurry tanks .
The HSENI is working with the Ulster Farmers ' Union ( UFU ) and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( DARD ) to develop a new Farm Safety Partnership .
Addressing farmers , Ken Logan , of the HSENI , said : " HSENI staff will be visiting your farm in order to discuss the dangers that you and your families face on a daily basis . "
Given that most Northern Ireland farms are worked by one or two people , this is a very personal message to you .
" Safety must be your number one priority as it is likely to be you or another family member who gets injured or killed . "
This help initiative will provide you with an opportunity to ask questions and seek advice from my colleagues .
