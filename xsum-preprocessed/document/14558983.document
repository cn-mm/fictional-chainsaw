Gloucestershire 's bid focused on Gloucester and Cinderford .
But Communities Minister Bob Neill said the county could still benefit from other job - creating projects .
" It 's no disgrace to Gloucestershire at all , they did hard work , I know that , " he said .
" And what I 'd say to them is do not be discouraged . "
We are working with local enterprise partnerships and local councils beyond the enterprise zone projects , for example giving councils the ability to discount business rates to attract businesses into the area , giving the ability to set up simplified planning regimes .
" Plans for 21 nationwide zones were first set out in March 's Budget .
Zones have been confirmed for sites in Cheshire , Cornwall , Gosport , Norfolk , Hereford , Kent and Oxfordshire .
Other locations include Essex , Suffolk , Northampton , Leicestershire , Cambridgeshire and the Humber Estuary .
Ministers said 30,000 new jobs would be created by 2015 by giving cheaper business rates , super-fast broadband and lower levels of planning control .
