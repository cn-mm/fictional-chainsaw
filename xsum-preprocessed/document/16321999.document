For Japan , 2011 was dominated by the earthquake and tsunami in March .
The disasters led to unprecedented numbers of Japanese helping one another .
After the tsunami smashed into Japan 's north - east coast on 11 March , killing thousands and engulfing entire communities , people 's stoicism and their determination to pull together won international praise .
In April the then prime minister Naoto Kan thanked the world for its help in a letter entitled " Kizuna - the Bonds of Friendship " .
And when Japan unexpectedly beat the United States to win the women 's football World Cup , " kizuna " forged by the players ' teamwork was cited with pride .
Half a million people took part in the annual poll for the kanji character , conducted by Japan 's Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation .
About 60,000 people nominated " kizuna " , but the runner - up was much less optimistic : " wazawai " means disaster .
For some Japanese , 2011 brought the opposite of " kizuna " .
A firm that specialised in divorce ceremonies said in July that they had tripled since the tsunami as people reassessed their lives .
